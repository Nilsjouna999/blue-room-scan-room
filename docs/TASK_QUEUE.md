# BLUE ROOM — Task Queue

Ranked work queue, not a dream backlog. One Active item at a time.
Out-of-scope findings from any session get logged here, not patched.
Last updated: 2026-06-13.

## Active

- **Distilled research checkpoint** (2026-06-13 / BR-S028, docs only): saved
  the distilled BLUE ROOM research into `docs/research/` — new
  `docs/research/README.md` + the pack **`RESEARCH_COMPRESSION_V1.md` (the
  compact research source for future coding/spec prompts)**,
  `HUMAN_IN_FRAME_READING_RULES_V1.md`, `RARE_ARTIFACT_TRIGGER_SYSTEM_V1.md`,
  `REFRAME_MAP_VALUE_SYSTEM_V1.md`, `LANGUAGE_SYSTEM_V1.md`. RESEARCH authority
  (informs, never implements — GOVERNANCE_OS §3); ACTIVE specs still win and
  the proposed stat-name / tier-ladder directions stay deferred to *Sample Room
  Tier Migration v1*. **Completed** — docs only, runtime untouched (no AI/
  backend/payment/Halo/upload analysis); GPT_REVIEW_GUIDE + CHANGE_MAP +
  SESSION_BRIEF note the folder. Roadmap unchanged. **Next up:** Free Pull Mock
  Polish v1 (Ready #0).

- **Free Pull Screenshot Audit** (2026-06-13 / BR-S027, audit only): audited
  the Free Pull mock (`?dev=free-scan-sim`) against
  `docs/FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1.md` §11/§13 at 1600×900 + 1920×1080.
  **Verdict: PASS WITH SMALL FIXES** — reads as one landscape graded-slab
  artifact, image-dominant, safety airtight (all five gates pass, lexicon sweep
  clean), sealed vault shape-only, Halo edge calm, all `?dev` routes + menu
  preserved, console clean. Findings → *Free Pull Mock Polish v1* (Ready #0):
  receipt chips too long (~110–116 chars, wrap 2–3 lines); title "DEV FREE SCAN
  FIXTURE" un-collectible; image↔archetype mismatch (daylight Driver vs "Low-
  Light Operator / Night Print"); ~12% side margin at 1920 (1500px cap) vs the
  5–7% target. **Completed** — no code changed (audit only).

- **Free Pull Layout Mock v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S027, app.js + styles.css):
  the dev route `?dev=free-scan-sim` now renders the **Free Pull front** as ONE
  landscape **graded-slab artifact** (image slab window ~52% + certification /
  stat-board label ~48%) per `docs/FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1.md` — slim
  persistent dev rail (DEV SIMULATION · NOT REAL ANALYSIS · NOT USER SCAN),
  4 public **tier-notch** stats (no 0–100; local display ladder Quiet/Present/
  Strong/Sharp/Dominant), 2 grounded receipt chips (cue → effect), a
  **shape-only sealed vault** (sealed stat name+reason no tier · Reframe Map
  counts only — fixes the old sim leaking full Reframe contents), quiet scope
  line, calm Halo seal edge. New `renderFreePullMock()`; `renderUploadedScanResultDev`
  branches to it only in sim mode (after validation), so `?dev=uploaded-result`
  / `?dev=uploaded-blocked` are unchanged. Slab image is `SOURCES[0]` as a
  clearly-labelled dev stand-in (fixture has no photo). **Completed & verified
  live** — landscape at 1600×900 + 1920×1080, image dominates, no public 0–100,
  vault shape-only (no Reframe leak), forbidden-lexicon sweep clean, console
  clean; both other `?dev` routes + bare-URL menu unchanged; normal Local Draft
  → Develop Scan still opens the sealed engine-offline gate (zero edits to
  draft/gate code); no AI/backend/payment/Halo unlock. Implements Ready #0.
  **Next up:** Free Pull Screenshot Audit (new Ready #0).

- **Free Pull Screenshot Layout Spec v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S026, docs only):
  new ACTIVE spec `docs/FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1.md` — defines the
  **front** of the Free Pull card as a **Split Artifact / Stat Board** (one
  landscape PC-first card: image ~48% near-fullbleed + title + print/serial/
  Free Pull badge; right ~52% = archetype teaser, 4 public **tier-band** stats
  Presence/Frame/Signal/Visual Impact (no 0–100), 2 grounded receipt chips,
  sealed vault [01 Sealed Stat name+reason · 02 Reframe Map shape only], quiet
  scope line, calm Halo seal edge). Adds screenshot rules, content budget,
  receipt + tier-band + sealed-vault grammar, anti-goals, and mock acceptance
  criteria. **Roadmap corrected**: the front is specified before the Halo
  *back* is mocked. §7 recommends bands Quiet/Set/Strong/Sharp/Dominant but
  **flags the divergence from `CARD_LOGIC_V1` §2** (does not override it) —
  reconcile in Sample Room Tier Migration v1. **Completed** — docs only,
  runtime unchanged (no AI/backend/upload/payment/Halo unlock/mock); FILE_MAP
  registers it. **Next up:** Free Pull Layout Mock v1 (Ready #0).

- **Halo Gate / Upgrade Layup v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S025, docs only): new
  ACTIVE spec `docs/HALO_GATE_UPGRADE_LAYUP_V1.md` — the Halo upgrade as a
  sealed-dossier ritual (Free complete, Halo opens the back of the same
  card; no reroll/gamble/rarity-chase), with gate timing/layout, Free
  preview vs Halo content, sealed-stat + Reframe-Map envelopes, per-scan
  price *framing* (no payment), ethical decline, post-unlock rhythm, a hard
  dark-pattern ban list, and a copy library. **Completed** — docs only,
  runtime unchanged, no payment; FILE_MAP registers it.
  **Next up:** Halo Gate Dev Mock v1 (Ready #0).

- **Card System Fixture Upgrade v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S024): dev-only Free
  Scan Simulation (`?dev=free-scan-sim`) upgraded to CARD_SYSTEM_V1 +
  CARD_LOGIC_V1 — public tier bands (no printed 0–100), grounded receipts
  (cue → effect), scope line, sealed-stat reason, rarity reason, Reframe Map
  preview. **Completed & verified live** — fixture still passes the
  (unchanged) validator; renderer gates new surfaces on field presence so
  uploaded-result/blocked routes, normal menu/draft/Develop-gate, sample
  room, and deep links are unchanged; review 3 low findings all fixed;
  console clean. Implements the *Card System Fixture Upgrade v1* Ready item.

- **Executable Card Logic v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S023, docs only): new ACTIVE
  spec `docs/CARD_LOGIC_V1.md` — public tier bands (no fake numbers),
  two-layer receipt grounding, 24 archetype triggers, sealed-stat / rarity /
  Reframe Map logic, low-info ladder, voice registers, Artifact-Test line
  check, validator targets. **Completed** — docs only, runtime unchanged;
  FILE_MAP registers it; review clean. **Next up:** Card System Fixture
  Upgrade v1 (Ready #0).

- **Card System Spec v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S022, docs only): new ACTIVE spec
  `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_V1.md` — Artifact Test, final v1 stats (4 Free / 6 Halo,
  Gesture Geometry rename), 10 lenses, 24 safe archetypes, receipt rules +
  20 examples, Free/Halo output, BLUE ROOM tone, forbidden language.
  **Completed** — docs only, runtime unchanged; refines SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC
  stat taxonomy; FILE_MAP registers it.
  **Next up:** Card System Fixture Upgrade v1 (Ready #0 below).

- **Free Scan Simulation v1 — Dev Only** (2026-06-13 / BR-S021): a dev-only
  `?dev=free-scan-sim` route showing a static 3-step staged flow (Intake →
  Development → validated Free preview) from `DEV_FIXTURES.validFreeSimulationResult`
  via `renderUploadedScanResultDev(result,{mode:'free-scan-sim'})` —
  validator-gated, labelled DEV SIMULATION / NOT REAL ANALYSIS / NOT USER
  SCAN, 4 visible stats + sealed Halo. **Completed & verified live** — no
  AI, no user-photo analysis; normal menu/draft/Develop-gate, both existing
  `?dev` routes, sample room, and deep links unchanged; review 0 findings;
  console clean. Not headlessly capturable (no screenshot).

- **Uploaded Scan Result Renderer v1 — Dev Harness** (2026-06-13 / BR-S020):
  a dev-only 4th view (`?dev=uploaded-result` | `?dev=uploaded-blocked`)
  that previews a *validated* future uploaded-result via
  `renderUploadedScanResultDev` — validator-gated (invalid → blocked
  state), labelled DEV HARNESS / NOT USER SCAN, plus a new
  `DEV_FIXTURES.validDevRendererResult`. **Completed & verified live** — no
  AI, no user-photo analysis, no menu link; normal menu/draft/Develop-gate,
  sample room, and both deep links unchanged; console clean. Dev harness
  not headlessly capturable (no screenshot).

- **Scan Engine Foundation v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S019): pure non-AI
  `scan-contract.js` (`window.BlueRoomScanContract`) —
  `validateUploadedScanResult` (uploaded-v1 shape + safety flags + evidence
  + forbidden-lexicon + sample-mixing blocks), `createBlockedScanState`,
  and `DEV_FIXTURES`; plus `renderBlockedScan` (calm safe-failure plate,
  foundation only, not wired). **Completed & verified live** — validator
  passes the valid fixture and rejects the four invalid ones; Develop Scan
  still opens the sealed offline gate; local draft still produces nothing;
  sample room + both deep links unchanged; console clean. This **completes
  the "Scan Contract Validator Stub v1"** Ready item (superseded). Spec
  field-name reconcile in SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT; FILE_MAP registers the
  script.

- **Scan Engine Contract v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S018): new ACTIVE spec
  `docs/SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` defining the future uploaded-photo result
  shape (`ScanResultUploaded v1`), allowed/forbidden lenses, lifecycle
  states, receipt rules, the Free/Halo reveal model, and engine-connection
  safety gates. **Completed** — docs only, runtime intentionally unchanged;
  uploaded results kept separate from sample ScanResult v2; `FILE_MAP`
  registers the new spec. Pushed at 2ad2fb3.

- **Local Draft Polish v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S017): presentation-only
  polish of the intake + sealed gate — cleaner filename label (title now
  "Local image" + compact "PNG · size · short…name", real name kept
  internally), tighter card hierarchy (prominent "No scan has run yet.",
  next-step "Ready for scan development."), CTA subcopy "Stage artifact for
  future scan engine.", gate offline dot + clearer "Development pending".
  **Completed** (app.js + styles.css + SESSION_BRIEF); no engine/analysis,
  reads only `draft`; sample room + both deep links verified live; console
  clean.
  *(Previous active — Scan Development Gate v1 — pushed at e19e183.)*

- **Scan Development Gate v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S016): Local Draft intake
  gains a "Develop scan" CTA → sealed **Scan Development Gate**
  (`state.draftGate`, `renderGate()`) saying the engine is not connected;
  disabled run button; generates NOTHING (no stats/receipts/oracle/hidden/
  mint/Halo), never calls getActiveScan/getScanResult or touches
  SOURCES/SCAN_RESULTS_V2. **Completed** (app.js + styles.css +
  SESSION_BRIEF); return/replace/sample-room/menu paths + both deep links
  verified live; gate not headlessly capturable (no screenshot); pushed at
  e19e183.
  *(Previous actives — Local Draft intake v1, Main Menu v1, conversion
  spine pass, product clarity pass, v2 rendering wiring, v2 data shape,
  SPINE promotion, governance OS, doc spine cleanup — completed
  2026-06-12/13.)*

## Ready (supported by current docs, clear definition of done)

   *(Scan Contract Validator Stub v1 — completed by BR-S019 Scan Engine
   Foundation v1; see Active.)*
   *(Card System Fixture Upgrade v1 — completed by BR-S024 for the
   `validFreeSimulationResult` sim fixture (tier bands, grounded receipts,
   scope/sealed/rarity/Reframe Map). `validDevRendererResult` (the raw
   uploaded-result harness) was intentionally left on its prior shape; a
   future pass can align it too if wanted.)*
   *(Free Pull Layout Mock v1 — completed by BR-S027; the `?dev=free-scan-sim`
   route renders the landscape split-artifact Free Pull front. See Active.)*
   *(Free Pull Screenshot Audit — completed by BR-S027 (audit only). Verdict:
   PASS WITH SMALL FIXES; findings feed Free Pull Mock Polish v1 below.)*
0. **Free Pull Mock Polish v1** (NEXT) — dev-route copy/polish for the Free Pull
   mock (`?dev=free-scan-sim`) from the BR-S027 audit. Scope: (1) shorten the 2
   receipt chips to tight `cue → effect` (≤ ~50 chars, e.g. "Raised palm →
   barrier signal", "Window light → cleaner edge separation"); (2) give the dev
   fixture a real artifact title instead of "DEV FREE SCAN FIXTURE"; (3) align
   the fixture archetype/print to the daylight Driver stand-in image (the
   "Low-Light Operator / Night Print" mismatch); (4) optional: raise `.fpwrap`
   max-width ~1560–1600px so 1920 margins land ~7–9%. Edits limited to the
   fixture text in `scan-contract.js`, chip handling in `app.js`
   `renderFreePullMock`, and optionally `.fpwrap` in `styles.css`. **Do NOT**
   change stat labels or the tier ladder (that is Sample Room Tier Migration v1)
   — see `docs/research/RESEARCH_COMPRESSION_V1.md` for the language candidates.
   *Done when:* chips are 1-line and Driver-coherent; title/archetype read as a
   real artifact; fixture still passes `validateUploadedScanResult` (no banned
   lexicon, all safetyFlags false, no public 0–100); `?dev=uploaded-result` /
   `?dev=uploaded-blocked` + normal menu/draft/Develop-gate unchanged; verified
   at 1600×900 + 1920×1080; console clean.
1. **Sample Room Tier Migration v1** — reconcile the legacy sample-room
   numeric display (`PROJECT_OS` §7/§9 still shows Presence/Frame/Signal/
   **Charge** as 0–100 numbers) into the public **tier-band** system, and
   ratify ONE authoritative public band ladder — reconciling
   `CARD_LOGIC_V1` §2 (QUIET/PRESENT/STRONG/DOMINANT/TOTAL) with
   `FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1` §7 (Quiet/Set/Strong/Sharp/Dominant) and
   the Charge→Visual Impact front swap (`CARD_SYSTEM_V1` §2).
   *Done when:* one band ladder is decided + logged (DECISION_LOG / owning
   spec); the sample room shows tier bands (no public 0–100); the §7/§2
   divergence is resolved, not duplicated; safety law unchanged.
2. **Halo Gate Dev Mock v1** — a dev-only mock of the Halo Gate from
   `docs/HALO_GATE_UPGRADE_LAYUP_V1.md`: a sealed-dossier chamber (sealed
   stat / Reframe-Map / evidence / oracle / mint envelopes showing *shape*,
   not contents), "Open Halo Dossier" / "Keep Free Pull", and a calm
   post-unlock reveal — **no payment, no checkout, no real unlock**; behind
   an explicit dev route, unmistakably labelled DEV. **Build the Free Pull
   front (Ready #0) first — a back must not be mocked before its front.**
   *Done when:* the mock renders the layout + copy from the spec; clicking
   "open" runs the calm reveal of the existing dev fixture's sealed contents
   (no Stripe, no fake urgency, no dark patterns); normal flow + sample room
   + deep links + the three existing `?dev` routes unchanged; reviewed.
3. **18-state audit** — PROJECT_OS §17.1. Walk 2 sources × 3 treatments
   (incl. Lab) × 3 tabs at 1600×900.
   *Done when:* every state screenshotted or DOM-verified; issues logged
   here, not fixed inline.
4. **data.js copy audit against COPY_SYSTEM** — the grammar postdates most
   shipped copy.
   *Done when:* every string in data.js passes the banned-word list, the
   tone test (§1) and the every-outcome-is-a-win rules (§5); fixes
   committed; no meaning drift.
5. **Render archetype discovery note in Halo** — PROJECT_OS visibility
   table promises "full archetype explanation + discovery note" in Halo;
   no data field or render exists yet. Pull discovery notes from
   COPY_SYSTEM §4 (Encounter / Dispatch).
   *Done when:* Halo shows the archetype class + discovery note (right
   panel or dossier §4/§5 — not on the card); Free shows label only.
6. **Three shiny material prototypes** — CARD_TECH_LAB §20: Cold Foil /
   Black Star / Night Gloss as data-only `halo` presets behind the Lab
   key, no layout changes.
   *Done when:* three presets switchable in Lab, screenshots captured and
   compared side-by-side, comparison filed in CARD_TECH_LAB.
7. **Dossier plate material polish** — taste debt from the 2026-06-12
   review: plates read flat next to the card; let the material accent
   bleed in (Mint Record plate already does).
   *Done when:* Halo dossier plates carry a restrained material accent;
   free stays matte; screenshots regenerated.
8. **Route label in Source Record** — the last remnant of v2 surfacing:
   one row in the dossier Source Record showing `scan.route` +
   `scanStatus` (e.g. "HUMAN_SOLO · accepted"), legacy-safe when v2
   absent. Tiny app.js change.
   *Done when:* the row renders in both states; copy passes COPY_SYSTEM.

## Backlog / needs decision

- **Final Halo material decision** — after Ready #6 (Three shiny material
  prototypes); log winner in DECISION_LOG, promote rules to PROJECT_OS
  (CARD_TECH_LAB §18/§20).
- **Develop/mint transformation moment** — CARD_TECH_LAB §15; needs scope
  decision (animation budget, where it triggers).
- **Rare-variant ladder** (Black Star etc. as tiers above Halo Mint) —
  needs the material decision first.
- **Local upload preview** (roadmap Phase 2) — only after the visual
  direction passes the "I want my own card" test.
- **Deterministic ScanResult engine** (Phase 3), **AI-assisted reading**
  (Phase 4), **$7 mint flow** (Phase 5), **Vault** (Phase 6).
- **Profile layers** (MBTI/zodiac/etc.) — user-provided only, never
  inferred; needs activation decision.
- **Mobile pass** — currently basic fallback by decision; needs a "now
  it matters" call.

## Retired / won't do

- Free Pull / Signature Mint / Halo Foil three-tier structure (retired
  2026-06-12; DECISION_LOG).
- Signature Mint as a customer-facing tier (survives only as internal
  Lab state + signature/mint language).
- "Develop into Halo Mint" as primary CTA (replaced by "Develop this
  scan").
- Face-rating, attractiveness scoring, social comparison, public
  rankings, friend comparisons — REJECTED permanently.
- Blur-veil paywall styling for free content (replaced by undeveloped
  archive plates).
- 10-fixture prototype and pre-isolation scan-room copy (archived to
  `_OLD_ARCHIVE_DO_NOT_USE`).
