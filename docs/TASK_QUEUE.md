# BLUE ROOM — Task Queue

Ranked work queue, not a dream backlog. One Active item at a time.
Out-of-scope findings from any session get logged here, not patched.
Last updated: 2026-06-12.

## Active

- **Card System Spec v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S022, docs only): new ACTIVE spec
  `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_V1.md` — Artifact Test, final v1 stats (4 Free / 6 Halo,
  Gesture Geometry rename), 10 lenses, 24 safe archetypes, receipt rules +
  20 examples, Free/Halo output, BLUE ROOM tone, forbidden language.
  **Completed** — docs only, runtime unchanged; refines SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC
  stat taxonomy; FILE_MAP registers it.
  **Next up:** Card System Fixture Upgrade v1 (Ready #0 below).

- **Free Scan Simulation v1 — Dev Only** (2026-06-13 / BR-S021): a dev-only
  `?dev=free-scan-sim` route showing a static 3-step staged flow (Intake →
  Development → validated Free preview) from `DEV_FIXTURES.validFreeSimulationResult`
  via `renderUploadedScanResultDev(result,{mode:'free-scan-sim'})` —
  validator-gated, labelled DEV SIMULATION / NOT REAL ANALYSIS / NOT USER
  SCAN, 4 visible stats + sealed Halo. **Completed & verified live** — no
  AI, no user-photo analysis; normal menu/draft/Develop-gate, both existing
  `?dev` routes, sample room, and deep links unchanged; review 0 findings;
  console clean. Not headlessly capturable (no screenshot).

- **Uploaded Scan Result Renderer v1 — Dev Harness** (2026-06-13 / BR-S020):
  a dev-only 4th view (`?dev=uploaded-result` | `?dev=uploaded-blocked`)
  that previews a *validated* future uploaded-result via
  `renderUploadedScanResultDev` — validator-gated (invalid → blocked
  state), labelled DEV HARNESS / NOT USER SCAN, plus a new
  `DEV_FIXTURES.validDevRendererResult`. **Completed & verified live** — no
  AI, no user-photo analysis, no menu link; normal menu/draft/Develop-gate,
  sample room, and both deep links unchanged; console clean. Dev harness
  not headlessly capturable (no screenshot).

- **Scan Engine Foundation v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S019): pure non-AI
  `scan-contract.js` (`window.BlueRoomScanContract`) —
  `validateUploadedScanResult` (uploaded-v1 shape + safety flags + evidence
  + forbidden-lexicon + sample-mixing blocks), `createBlockedScanState`,
  and `DEV_FIXTURES`; plus `renderBlockedScan` (calm safe-failure plate,
  foundation only, not wired). **Completed & verified live** — validator
  passes the valid fixture and rejects the four invalid ones; Develop Scan
  still opens the sealed offline gate; local draft still produces nothing;
  sample room + both deep links unchanged; console clean. This **completes
  the "Scan Contract Validator Stub v1"** Ready item (superseded). Spec
  field-name reconcile in SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT; FILE_MAP registers the
  script.

- **Scan Engine Contract v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S018): new ACTIVE spec
  `docs/SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` defining the future uploaded-photo result
  shape (`ScanResultUploaded v1`), allowed/forbidden lenses, lifecycle
  states, receipt rules, the Free/Halo reveal model, and engine-connection
  safety gates. **Completed** — docs only, runtime intentionally unchanged;
  uploaded results kept separate from sample ScanResult v2; `FILE_MAP`
  registers the new spec. Pushed at 2ad2fb3.

- **Local Draft Polish v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S017): presentation-only
  polish of the intake + sealed gate — cleaner filename label (title now
  "Local image" + compact "PNG · size · short…name", real name kept
  internally), tighter card hierarchy (prominent "No scan has run yet.",
  next-step "Ready for scan development."), CTA subcopy "Stage artifact for
  future scan engine.", gate offline dot + clearer "Development pending".
  **Completed** (app.js + styles.css + SESSION_BRIEF); no engine/analysis,
  reads only `draft`; sample room + both deep links verified live; console
  clean.
  *(Previous active — Scan Development Gate v1 — pushed at e19e183.)*

- **Scan Development Gate v1** (2026-06-13 / BR-S016): Local Draft intake
  gains a "Develop scan" CTA → sealed **Scan Development Gate**
  (`state.draftGate`, `renderGate()`) saying the engine is not connected;
  disabled run button; generates NOTHING (no stats/receipts/oracle/hidden/
  mint/Halo), never calls getActiveScan/getScanResult or touches
  SOURCES/SCAN_RESULTS_V2. **Completed** (app.js + styles.css +
  SESSION_BRIEF); return/replace/sample-room/menu paths + both deep links
  verified live; gate not headlessly capturable (no screenshot); pushed at
  e19e183.
  *(Previous actives — Local Draft intake v1, Main Menu v1, conversion
  spine pass, product clarity pass, v2 rendering wiring, v2 data shape,
  SPINE promotion, governance OS, doc spine cleanup — completed
  2026-06-12/13.)*

## Ready (supported by current docs, clear definition of done)

   *(Scan Contract Validator Stub v1 — completed by BR-S019 Scan Engine
   Foundation v1; see Active.)*
0. **Card System Fixture Upgrade v1** (NEXT) — align the dev fixtures in
   `scan-contract.js` (`validDevRendererResult`, `validFreeSimulationResult`)
   to `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_V1.md`: Free-front stats = Presence/Frame/Signal/
   Visual Impact; Charge + the new Halo-depth stats (Gesture Geometry /
   Setting Gravity / Artifact Coherence) move to `haloExtended`; v1 archetype
   names; receipts in the new lens vocabulary.
   *Done when:* updated fixtures still pass `validateUploadedScanResult`; the
   dev/sim renderers show the v1 stat layout; no AI, no real analysis, no
   data.js sample insertion, normal flow + deep links unchanged. (May need a
   small `SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC` reconcile note.)
1. **18-state audit** — PROJECT_OS §17.1. Walk 2 sources × 3 treatments
   (incl. Lab) × 3 tabs at 1600×900.
   *Done when:* every state screenshotted or DOM-verified; issues logged
   here, not fixed inline.
2. **data.js copy audit against COPY_SYSTEM** — the grammar postdates most
   shipped copy.
   *Done when:* every string in data.js passes the banned-word list, the
   tone test (§1) and the every-outcome-is-a-win rules (§5); fixes
   committed; no meaning drift.
3. **Render archetype discovery note in Halo** — PROJECT_OS visibility
   table promises "full archetype explanation + discovery note" in Halo;
   no data field or render exists yet. Pull discovery notes from
   COPY_SYSTEM §4 (Encounter / Dispatch).
   *Done when:* Halo shows the archetype class + discovery note (right
   panel or dossier §4/§5 — not on the card); Free shows label only.
4. **Three shiny material prototypes** — CARD_TECH_LAB §20: Cold Foil /
   Black Star / Night Gloss as data-only `halo` presets behind the Lab
   key, no layout changes.
   *Done when:* three presets switchable in Lab, screenshots captured and
   compared side-by-side, comparison filed in CARD_TECH_LAB.
5. **Dossier plate material polish** — taste debt from the 2026-06-12
   review: plates read flat next to the card; let the material accent
   bleed in (Mint Record plate already does).
   *Done when:* Halo dossier plates carry a restrained material accent;
   free stays matte; screenshots regenerated.
6. **Route label in Source Record** — the last remnant of v2 surfacing:
   one row in the dossier Source Record showing `scan.route` +
   `scanStatus` (e.g. "HUMAN_SOLO · accepted"), legacy-safe when v2
   absent. Tiny app.js change.
   *Done when:* the row renders in both states; copy passes COPY_SYSTEM.

## Backlog / needs decision

- **Final Halo material decision** — after Ready #4; log winner in
  DECISION_LOG, promote rules to PROJECT_OS (CARD_TECH_LAB §18/§20).
- **Develop/mint transformation moment** — CARD_TECH_LAB §15; needs scope
  decision (animation budget, where it triggers).
- **Rare-variant ladder** (Black Star etc. as tiers above Halo Mint) —
  needs the material decision first.
- **Local upload preview** (roadmap Phase 2) — only after the visual
  direction passes the "I want my own card" test.
- **Deterministic ScanResult engine** (Phase 3), **AI-assisted reading**
  (Phase 4), **$7 mint flow** (Phase 5), **Vault** (Phase 6).
- **Profile layers** (MBTI/zodiac/etc.) — user-provided only, never
  inferred; needs activation decision.
- **Mobile pass** — currently basic fallback by decision; needs a "now
  it matters" call.

## Retired / won't do

- Free Pull / Signature Mint / Halo Foil three-tier structure (retired
  2026-06-12; DECISION_LOG).
- Signature Mint as a customer-facing tier (survives only as internal
  Lab state + signature/mint language).
- "Develop into Halo Mint" as primary CTA (replaced by "Develop this
  scan").
- Face-rating, attractiveness scoring, social comparison, public
  rankings, friend comparisons — REJECTED permanently.
- Blur-veil paywall styling for free content (replaced by undeveloped
  archive plates).
- 10-fixture prototype and pre-isolation scan-room copy (archived to
  `_OLD_ARCHIVE_DO_NOT_USE`).
