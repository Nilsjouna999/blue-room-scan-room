# BLUE ROOM — Session Brief

Reusable per-session scope file. Fill the template at the start of every
coding session; the assistant must respect it. Files not listed under
**Edit** are read-only or off-limits (FILE_MAP scope rule).

## Example session: visual review URL cleanup

**Today's task:** Fix the raw screenshot URLs in the visual-review docs so
external reviewers can open them directly.

**Why:** Reviewers reported the raw URL pattern was a placeholder; visual
review depends on working image links.

**Read:** docs/FILE_MAP.md · docs/SCREENS.md · docs/GPT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md

**Edit:** docs/SCREENS.md · docs/GPT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md

**Do not open:** index.html, styles.css, app.js, data.js — unless verifying
a link target requires it (read-only if so).

**Locked constraints:** No product/UI changes; no new sections; raw base is
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nilsjouna999/blue-room-scan-room/main/`.

**Known current state:** 10 PNGs exist in docs/screens/ (verify with
`dir docs/screens/` before writing any filename).

**Definition of done:** Every screenshot entry in SCREENS.md carries a full
direct raw URL using a real filename; GPT_REVIEW_GUIDE points reviewers at
SCREENS.md and the correct base; `git diff --stat` shows only docs/ changes.

**Verification:** `git status` + `git diff --stat`; fetch one raw URL and
confirm HTTP 200 image/png.

**Final response format:**
Files created · Files changed · What changed · What was intentionally not changed · Stale claims skipped · Verification result · Git commands
