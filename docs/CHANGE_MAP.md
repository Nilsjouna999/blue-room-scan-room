# BLUE ROOM — Change Map

Practical "where do I change this?" guide for `blue-room-scan-room/`.
Read the matching section *before* editing. Last updated: 2026-06-14.
(How-to sections are current; the dated changelog blocks below run through BR-S044 —
BR-S045–S056 are docs / small-CSS, tracked in `TASK_QUEUE.md` + `DECISION_LOG.md`.)

General test loop for any change:
`python -m http.server 8743` in the project folder → open
http://localhost:8743 → walk 2 sources × 3 treatments × 3 tabs → check the
browser console is clean (F12).

---

## To change text (titles, verdicts, readings, copy)

- **Edit:** `data.js` only. Card text lives in each source's `card` object
  (`title`, `archetype`, `note`, `signature`); reading text in `reads`,
  `aura`, `sceneRole`, `stance`, `fit`, `oracle`; left-panel text in
  `capture`, `analysis`, `diagram.notes`.
- **Affects:** card + right panel + left panel, depending on field.
- **Can break:** nothing structural. Long titles can wrap the card title
  block; very long verdicts grow the card height.
- **Test:** check the card still fits the stage at 1600×900 (no scrollbar in
  the center column) and the voice rules in PROJECT_OS §14.

## To change stats (values)

- **Edit:** `data.js` → `card.stats` per source.
- **Affects:** card stat block, Metrics stat diamond, right-panel stat
  reading values.
- **Can break:** nothing; values are 0–100. Keep the *reading text* in
  `reads` consistent with the new number.
- **Test:** Metrics tab diamond shape updates; card numbers match.

## To change stats (names) — high risk

- **Edit:** `data.js` (`stats` keys, `FORMULAS`), `app.js` (`miniStat` calls
  in `renderCard`, the `["presence","frame","signal","charge"]` array in
  `renderReadingPanel`, `statDiamond` order array).
- **Affects:** everything — card, metrics, right panel, formulas.
- **Can break:** any missed reference renders `undefined`.
- **Test:** all three tabs + card + receipts; search the repo for the old
  name. Per PROJECT_OS §9 the current names are an audited decision — log a
  reason in DECISION_LOG.md first.

## To change source images

- **Edit:** drop the file in `assets/`, point `file` in `data.js` at it
  (any of .jpg/.jpeg/.png). Update `photoTuning` (`pos`, `zoom`, `scrim`,
  `base`) for the new image, and realistically `markers`, `diagram`,
  `analysis` — those coordinates are per-photo.
- **Affects:** left panel image + card photo (same file, raw on the left,
  tuned on the card).
- **Can break:** stale coordinates draw markers/diagrams in wrong places;
  missing file shows "Missing image file: …" warning (by design).
- **Test:** Source + Diagram tabs — markers sit on the right features; card
  crop keeps the subject readable in all three treatments.

## To change diagrams

- **Edit:** `data.js` → `diagram` per source: `massBox`, `gesture`
  (`points`, `label`, optional `labelAt`), `axis`, `arrow`, `light`,
  `pressure`, `notes`. Coordinates are % of the displayed frame
  (0–100 × 0–100). Portrait images need `aspect` set (SRC 02 = 2.22) so
  circles/arrowheads stay round.
- **Affects:** Diagram tab only.
- **Can break:** labels can collide with each other or the corner meta chip
  — eyeball it; wrong `aspect` makes dots/rings into stretched blobs.
- **Test:** Diagram tab in free (limited set: grid + focal + mass) and mint
  (full set), both sources.

## To change metrics

- **Edit:** `data.js` → `metrics` per source: `signalMix` (5 rows),
  `pressure` (`balance` −50..50, `centerPull`, `noise`, `clarity`),
  `fitMatrix` (4 cells: `k`, `state`, `v`).
- **Affects:** Metrics tab only (lore/impact come from the existing `lore` /
  `impact` fields and show in the right panel).
- **Can break:** nothing structural. Keep signalMix roughly summing to 100 —
  it's presented as a recipe.
- **Test:** Metrics tab free (diamond + mix visible, pressure + fit veiled)
  and mint (all visible).

## To change treatment colors / effects

- **Edit:** `styles.css` only. Tokens at the top (`--moss*`, `--silver*`,
  `--violet/--cyan/--halo-green`); treatment blocks:
  `.card[data-treatment="free"|"mint"|"shiny"]` for the card,
  `body[data-treatment=…]` for page-level accents (badges, diagram strokes,
  diamond fill). Photo look = `--tb/--tc/--ts` multipliers per treatment.
- **Affects:** the entire feel of Free/Mint/Halo.
- **Can break:** the "free must stay mellow / violet-cyan-green only in
  shiny" rules (PROJECT_OS §10, §4); photo readability under heavy overlays.
- **Test:** all three treatments on both sources; the photo must stay
  clearly visible in every state.

## To change a base / foundation token (palette lock) — high risk

- **Edit:** `styles.css` `:root` only (the `--ink-*` room ramp, the `--t-*` Sand
  text ramp). The canonical values these names must carry live in
  `docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md` → "Locked token canon"; the lock + its rationale live in
  `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
- **Log first:** a foundation token (base hex, the warm ramp, a tier ratio) is
  governed — add a `DECISION_LOG` entry **before/with** the CSS and backfill
  `DESIGN_TOKENS` in the **same commit** (GOVERNANCE_OS Spec Change Review).
- **Affects:** potentially the whole room — `--ink-*` are background substrates
  (body radial-gradient, card/draft/gate/dev plates); `--t-*` are all foreground
  text tiers + the tier-band lightness.
- **Can break:** contrast in two *directions* — `--ink-900` is dark text on LIGHT
  chips (`.toggle__btn.is-active`, `.marker__no`, `.markerlegend__no`) AND a dark
  substrate; a global shift cannot serve both. The LOCKED per-source Copper/Frost
  plates (DECISION_LOG 2026-06-12) and the LOCKED Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/Peak
  band ladder (2026-06-13) must not be silently moved.
- **Test:** node is NOT installed — verify in-browser via `getComputedStyle`
  (the screenshot tool times out). Confirm the changed token resolves to its new
  value and the *unchanged* tokens are byte-identical; walk 2 sources × free/shiny
  + the 7-plate dossier + the 4 `?dev` routes + bare menu; console clean.

## To change card layout — high risk

- **Edit:** `app.js` → `renderCard()` (structure) + `styles.css` (card
  section).
- **Affects:** the main trophy in every state.
- **Can break:** the LOCKED content list (PROJECT_OS §7 — no graphs/
  diagrams/long prose on the card); height fit at 1600×900 (~786px card vs
  ~816px stage); the one-master-base law.
- **Test:** card fully visible without scrolling at 1600×900 in all three
  treatments; check 1920×1080 (card grows to 550px).

## To change right panel modules

- **Edit:** `app.js` → `renderReadingPanel()` (which modules, order,
  free/paid gating, locked set) + `styles.css` (`.panel--reading` chrome);
  content in `data.js`.
- **Affects:** paid value perception, free-to-paid clarity.
- **Can break:** the free teaser logic (locked = stance/fit/oracle; the
  unlock card lists the rest) — keep gating consistent with PROJECT_OS §8.
- **Test:** free vs mint vs shiny right panel; develop buttons still switch
  treatment.
- **BR-S088 register + subtraction law:** the PAID panel is a tight VOICE/SUMMARY
  column (Oracle → Stat Reading → Scene Role → Artifact Archetype → Technical
  Receipts) — it must NOT re-render the dossier's deeper material. Stance / Fit /
  Frame Impact / Lore Density / Mint Record / (paid) Aura were cut from the panel;
  the dossier (Plate 05 Fit + Aura, Plate 06 Mint Record) is their sole home. When
  adding a panel module, ask: is this a VOICE/summary beat, or does it belong in the
  dossier? Interpretive verdict prose uses the serif register (`.dstat__evidence`,
  `.module__line` → `--font-display` ~15px `--text`); admin/proof (key-value grids,
  mono receipts, serials, bars/tier chips) stays the quiet flat cue. Free is
  unaffected by the cuts (free renders `lockedDeep`) — keep it that way.

## To change dossier hierarchy / neighborhood legibility (BR-S089)

- **Edit:** `styles.css` dossier block — `.dossier__cue` (the room→card-back seam threshold),
  `.dossier__register` (the DEVELOPED RECORD / ARTIFACT PROVENANCE strips), `.dossier__inner
  .dplate:nth-of-type(1/4/6/7)` (the quiet/LOUD rhythm: padding + title + spine scale + the one
  2px `--line-strong` ledger edge), and `.drecord dd` / `.dfiling*` / `.dlineage*` (Source 01 +
  Mint 06 record tone). Content/order lives in `app.js renderDossier`.
- **Affects:** the Card Back / Artifact Record pacing. Target read: quiet filing (Source 01 / Mint
  06) → medium (Evidence 02 / Stat 03 / Fit 05) → LOUD payoff (Hidden Stat 04 / Oracle 07).
- **Can break:** the `nth-of-type(1/4/6/7)` rhythm is POSITIONAL — reordering / adding / removing a
  `.dplate`, or changing `.dossier__register` / `.dossier__cue` from `<div>` to `<section>`, silently
  re-indexes every quiet/LOUD selector. Keep the strips `<div>`; keep exactly 7 plates.
- **Law:** loudness = spacing + type-scale + contrast + the single existing `--line-strong` ledger
  edge — NEVER a new edge/tint/glow/gradient or a 3rd accent site. The two `--halo-a` moments
  (Hidden Stat value, Oracle edge) are the whole accent economy. No reveal/motion. Demote by tone,
  never by deleting record rows. Free stays complete (shared CSS may improve Free legibility only).
- **Test:** shiny src1/src2 + free src1 + the normal-scroll seam + the full dossier; 7
  `section.dplate`; register strips still `<div>`; console clean.

## Product clarity pass (2026-06-12, data.js + app.js + tiny CSS)

State taglines added to `TREATMENTS` (free: "First pull — the surface
scan…"; halo: "Fully developed — structured evidence, hidden stat, mint
record, oracle."), rendered as one quiet line in the Scan Reading header.
Free CTA tightened: lead line "The full reading is already written into
this image. Minting develops it."; button subline "the card finishes
developing"; module laundry-list replaced with a prioritized hook line
(hidden stat first). Dossier CTA subline aligned. Field label "Dominant
Gesture" → "Lead Gesture"; one analysis note reworded — full
banned/hype-word sweep now clean across all states.

## To change the local draft intake

- **Edit:** structure/content in `app.js` → `renderDraft()` + the
  `loadDraftFile()` / `pickPhoto()` / `humanSize()` helpers and the
  `draft` module var (a plain object — NOT a ScanResult). Styling in
  `styles.css` (`.draft*`, `.draftcard*`). The mount (`#draftView`) and
  the hidden `<input type="file" accept="image/*">` live in `index.html`.
- **View model:** `state.view` gains a third value `draft`; `applyView()`
  + the `body[data-view]` visibility matrix show exactly one of
  menu/room/draft. Reached only by a user file pick (`[data-draft-pick]`)
  — never via URL. `URL.createObjectURL` preview, revoked on replace.
- **Hard rule:** the draft shows NO analysis — no stats, receipts,
  oracle, hidden stat, score, or serial. If a number appears on the draft
  card it is a bug. No upload, no storage, no AI.
- **Develop Scan gate:** the intake's "Develop scan" CTA flips
  `state.draftGate` and re-renders `#draftView` via `renderGate()` — a
  sealed, generate-nothing chamber (`[data-gate="open|close"]`). Same hard
  rule: no analysis, no numbers, no sample-data calls.
- **Test:** Add your photo → Local Draft preview; non-image rejected;
  replace revokes the old object URL; Replace / Enter sample room / Main
  menu / Resume all work; deep links still bypass to the room.

## To change the front-door menu

- **Edit:** structure/content in `app.js` → `renderMenu()` (pulls
  title/archetype/material from `SOURCES[0]` + `TREATMENTS` stamps — no
  separate menu data, no fabricated stats); styling in `styles.css` (the
  "Main Menu" block: `.menu*`, `.msample*`, `.mtile*`); the mount +
  `data-view="menu"` default live in `index.html` (`#menuView`).
- **View model:** `state.view` is `"menu"` or `"room"`; `applyView()`
  writes `body[data-view]`. Any deep-link param (`src`/`t`/`tab`) forces
  `view="room"` at init so links bypass the menu. `[data-view-to]`
  buttons switch views ("Enter Scan Room" → room; footer "↑ Menu" →
  menu); Enter key on the menu also enters the room.
- **Can break:** the one-sample rule (do NOT add route cards or new
  assets); the no-face-rating law (the trust line and tiles read the
  image, never the person); the Room/Plate/Artifact law (Free tile flat
  plate, Halo tile = the only depth/material element).
- **Test:** bare URL shows the menu; the four deep links open the room
  directly; Enter Scan Room reveals the unchanged room.

## Dev nav rail (?devnav=1) — dev only

- **What:** a sticky on-screen rail to jump between states without typing URLs —
  Menu/Room · SRC 01/02 · Free/Halo/Lab · Source/Diagram/Metrics · the 4 dev
  fixtures. Reveals ONLY on `?devnav=1`; never shown to a real user.
- **Edit:** `index.html` (`<nav id="devnav" hidden>`), `app.js` (`renderDevnav()`,
  the delegated `[data-devnav="kind:val"]` handler, the `DEVNAV` flag + mount after
  `mountMenu()`), `styles.css` (`.devnav` block).
- **Add a button:** add `b("kind:val", "Label")` in `renderDevnav()`; kinds are
  `view | treat | src | tab | dev`. `treat/src/tab` also enter the room so the change
  is visible; `dev` reloads carrying `&devnav=1` (`mountDev` runs only at init).
- **Can break:** nothing for real users — triple-gated by `body[data-devnav="1"]`
  + CSS `display:none` + the `hidden` attribute. Keep all three; never auto-reveal it.
- **Test:** `?devnav=1` shows the rail and each button lands its state; a clean URL
  (no `?devnav`) shows NO rail (`display:none`, body has no `data-devnav`, rail unfilled).

## Source→Diagram Merge v1 — Left redesign (2026-06-14 / BR-S044, app.js + styles.css)

`LAYUP_RESEARCH_V1` Task #4: collapsed the **Source tab into Diagram** (3 tabs → 2). The scanframe now carries
a flat **Annotated | Clean toggle** — `state.diagramView` (default `annotated`; `?dv=` deep link), applied as
a state class on `.diagwrap`. **CLEAN** = the old Source frame (full-saturation raw photo + numbered markers +
legend); **ANNOTATED** = desaturated photo + the SVG diagram overlay. **No data.js change**; free/halo overlay
gating is unchanged (orthogonal to clean/annotated). Deleted the redundant **Capture Record** module (the
Source ID/code that duplicated the card + dossier Plate 01); **Lens + Light** kept as a hairline `scanframe`
meta line. The 5 Frame Analysis lines moved under a **"Frame Read"** sub-label in Diagram Notes. Legacy
**`?tab=source` redirects to `diagram`** (no 404) and the dev-nav Source button was dropped.
**To work on the merged frame:** the Diagram/scanframe render + the `diagramView` toggle + the
`?tab=source`→`diagram` redirect live in `app.js`; the clean/annotated visual states + scanframe meta live in
`styles.css` (the `.diagwrap` block). Pre-edit 4-lens critique → GO_WITH_CHANGES. **Per commit, verified
live** (2 tabs, both toggle states, the redirect, free gating, src2, Metrics + card + 7 plates, console clean;
temp index.html cache-bust used + reverted). Rollback: `git revert 93027fb`.

## Human-Read Line copy sweep v1 (2026-06-14 / BR-S043, data.js)

The do-now safety fix from the `/gods-finger` audit (per `docs/HUMAN_READ_LINE_V1.md`): **9 sample-copy
rewrites across 8 lines** in `data.js` (8 ins / 8 del) so every visible reading names the **re-authorable
image-act, not the permanent person**. Removed anatomy-as-composition ("the cap and beard do quiet structural
work", "beard … build a stable mass"), trait grammar ("the posture of someone who decides / plans to be
here"), dispositional energy ("Slow-burn output"), authenticity-as-trait ("nothing performed for the lens",
"less like a pose"), and the character aura chips ("Slow-Burn" / "Load-Bearing" → "Auger-Braced" /
"Low-Horizon"). Each rewrite names a visible cue and makes the photo the grammatical subject.
**To change this copy:** it lives in `data.js` (the per-source reading / aura / evidence / stance fields) —
keep the photo as the grammatical subject and avoid permanent-person grammar (the Human-Read Line). No new
fields; voice preserved. **Per commit, verified live** (room + 7 plates render, aura chips updated, no leak
strings, console clean). **Note:** the Backlog (a) bullet in TASK_QUEUE + the `HUMAN_READ_LINE_V1`
§enforcement-gap leak example still quote these now-removed strings (stale-by-omission); update when guards
(b)/(c) land. Rollback: `git revert 989d131`.

## Repo cleanup pass v1 — safe /cleanup (2026-06-14 / BR-S042, styles.css + app.js + data.js + docs)

Ran the saved `/cleanup` routine across all tracked source files — behavior-preserving, every deletion
grep-confirmed zero-reference, one category per commit. **Dead CSS removed** (`5f3a776`): the orphaned
compare-ladder selectors (`.msample__compare`, `.mtile` base, `.mtile--free/--halo`,
`.mtile__stamp--halo/__cap/__tier/__tier--halo/__chips`, `.msample__arrow` + responsive override) +
pre-existing dead `.draftcard__note`, `.draftinfo__meta`, `.fpcard__vrow/__vno/__vbody/__vname`; KEPT the
live `.mtile__shot/__img/__scrim/__stamp` + `.fpcard__vault/…`. **Unused local removed** (`adebc87`):
`tierOut` in `renderDossier` (its source `getTierOutput` is pure, so the discarded call was safe to drop).
**Comment/doc accuracy**: data.js v2 header corrected (it IS read by app.js); the mistaken `<\button>`
typo claim removed from the BR-S041 docs (grep showed the resume branch is correctly `</button>` — no
typo existed). Verified live after each category (menu card / free-scan-sim vault / 7-plate dossier
render; console clean). **Proposed — not applied (user's call):** remove now-uncalled
`getTierOutput`/`getActiveScan`; drop the dead `sim`-truthy branches in `renderUploadedScanResultDev`
(unreachable after the early `if (sim) return …`); drop the unread `gestureAuthority` field in
`toScanResultV2`. Next: Left redesign (Source merge).

## Menu Re-frame v1 — Direction A "Sealed Pull" (2026-06-14 / BR-S041, app.js renderMenu + styles.css)

The "layup" fix from `FREE_PAID_MODEL_V1`: the complete-front/sealed-back model is LOCKED-right;
the defect was tier-ladder FRAMING in the menu. **Removed** the `.msample__compare` block (the
Free-vs-Halo tiles + the "→ develops" arrow + the Halo inventory chips) and the "developed two ways"
footer. **Added** ONE complete Free Pull card via the existing `shot()` helper inside a new
`.msample__solo` figure — because `.mtile--free` is NOT applied, the card renders at FULL saturation
(no desaturation filter / matte scrim) — plus a `.msample__seal` caption "The front is complete. The
same card has a sealed back." (a structural fact, never "unlock/you're missing"). Footer → "One sample
· SRC-01 · Driver." `.menu__inner` max-width 760→500 to balance the single artifact. Thesis + trust
verbatim; CTA stays "Enter Scan Room" (NOT "Develop" — paid verb); `renderHaloGateMock` + darkroom
copy untouched. **Direction chosen** via a 16-agent design pass (5 Haiku / 8 Sonnet / 3 Opus → judge →
synth → adversarial safety = SAFE, 0 fixes); builder picked A ("inviting + balanced") keeping B's
caption. No DECISION_LOG (ACTIVE implementation of a researched fix). **Dead CSS left for the queued
/cleanup pass:** `.mtile--free/--halo`, `.msample__compare`, `.msample__arrow`, `.mtile__chips/__tier/
__cap` are now unused — but `.mtile__shot/__img/__scrim/__stamp` STAY (reused by `shot()`). **Verified live**: bare URL →
one full-saturation card (filter:none, no scrim), FREE PULL stamp, the sealed caption, no compare/
arrow/chips; 360×270 card in a 500px column; deep links still bypass to the room; `?devnav=1` rail +
Enter/Add still work; console clean. **Next up:** run /cleanup on the menu diff, then Left redesign
(Source merge).

## Dev Nav Rail v1 (2026-06-14 / BR-S040, index.html + app.js + styles.css)

Added a dev-only state-jumper rail revealed ONLY by `?devnav=1` — Menu/Room · SRC
01/02 · Free/Halo/Lab · Source/Diagram/Metrics · the 4 dev fixtures + a "◆ DEV" tag.
One `<nav id="devnav" hidden>`, one `renderDevnav()`, one delegated
`[data-devnav="kind:val"]` handler reusing the existing setters (`applyView`/`render`),
a `DEVNAV` flag + mount after `mountMenu()`, and a `.devnav` CSS block. **Defense-in-depth
gate:** `display:none` unless `body[data-devnav="1"]` (set only on the flag) AND the
`hidden` attribute — so it can never paint for a real user (verified: a clean
`?src=1&t=shiny` deep link leaves the rail unfilled + `display:none`, body has no
`data-devnav`). Dev-fixture buttons `location.href`-reload carrying `&devnav=1`
(`mountDev` runs only at init — `replaceState` rejected, it would skip the fixture
render). **Pre-edit 3-agent critique → GO_WITH_CHANGES**; folded in: cut the
"pick"/draft button (product side-effect + silent-fail), the body-attr+CSS gate, the
DEV tag. No DECISION_LOG (routine dev tooling, no product/spec change). **Verified
live** (`?devnav=1`): rail sticky + all 14 buttons land their state; treat/src/tab
enter the room; Halo-Gate fixture reloads + rail persists; clean URLs + bare menu show
no rail; console clean. Additive — revert = delete the block. **Next up:** Menu
re-frame (the "layup" fix).

## Base-Hex + Warm-Ramp Lock v1 (2026-06-14 / BR-S039, styles.css `:root` + governance docs)

Locked the token foundation `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_V1` gates contrast/type work on.
**Narrowed from the "Token Foundation Lock v1" prompt by the mandatory 11-agent
pre-edit critique → NARROW_SCOPE:** the prompt's other three sub-parts were
impossible/illegal as written — `--vault-*` is defined **nowhere in code** (a
doc-only artifact in `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_V1` + `TEXT_EYE_TRAVEL`), "one plate-bg hex"
collides with the LOCKED per-source Copper/Frost plates (2026-06-12), and the
tier-ratio / engraved-shadow re-tune touches the LOCKED Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/
Peak ladder (2026-06-13) / a letterpress shadow PAIR that does not exist.
**Shipped (one commit):** `styles.css` `--ink-950 #0a0907 → #0a0b0d` (the deepest
room-shadow floor; the only token value changed) + the `:root` Sand-ramp / room-base
comments naming the lock; `--t-*` warm Sand ramp affirmed UNCHANGED; `DECISION_LOG`
entry (the `#0a0b0d`-vs-`#0a0907` resolution + the cool-floor/warm-text tension);
`DESIGN_TOKENS` "Locked token canon" backfill; `TEXT_EYE_TRAVEL` cool `--vault-*` ramp
annotated SUPERSEDED. **Deferred to TASK_QUEUE (gated behind this lock):** *Tier-ratio
re-derivation v1* (preserve the band ladder) and *Plate-bg consolidation v1* (preserve
the per-source plates; engraved-shadow re-tune is its last step). Visual delta ≈ nil
(floor shift < 1% luminance, never under text). Rollback: `git revert <hash>`.

## Distilled research checkpoint (2026-06-13 / BR-S028, docs only)

Saved the distilled BLUE ROOM research into `docs/research/` so future
GPT/Claude sessions keep the artifact-language, stat/tier, human-in-frame,
rare-trigger, Reframe Map, and voice rules. New files: `docs/research/README.md`
(folder guide + RESEARCH-authority + live-divergence notes) + the distilled
pack — **`RESEARCH_COMPRESSION_V1.md` (the compact source for future coding/spec
prompts)**, `HUMAN_IN_FRAME_READING_RULES_V1.md`, `RARE_ARTIFACT_TRIGGER_SYSTEM_V1.md`,
`REFRAME_MAP_VALUE_SYSTEM_V1.md`, `LANGUAGE_SYSTEM_V1.md`. These are
**RESEARCH (informs, never implements** — GOVERNANCE_OS §3); ACTIVE specs still
win, and the stat-name / tier-ladder divergences they propose stay deferred to
*Sample Room Tier Migration v1*. **Docs only — runtime unchanged** (no
app.js/styles.css/data.js/scan-contract.js/index.html edits; no AI/backend/
payment/Halo/upload analysis). GPT_REVIEW_GUIDE + TASK_QUEUE + SESSION_BRIEF
note the folder. Roadmap unchanged beyond this checkpoint — next product task
stays **Free Pull Mock Polish v1**.

## Research Synthesis v1 — the canon (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_V1.md` (RESEARCH CANON; FILE_MAP registers it as
START-HERE) from a 19-agent White Death AUDIT over all 15 research docs (1 Sonnet distiller per
doc → Opus consolidate → Opus works-together + Opus conflict-hunter → Opus rank). **Verdict: the
research COHERES** — 64 high-value+high-confidence survivors (54 KEEP, 10 DILUTE), 62 killed, and
every clash is a CSS/copy/spec reconciliation, NOT a model contradiction. The doc is the
reconciliation layer atop the 6 spine + 9 foundational docs: the 9 coherent systems (Master Law
Stack · Closed Language System · Three-Layer Scan Engine · Honest Free/Paid Seam · Depth Physics ·
Typographic Hierarchy · Engineered-Instrument Chrome · Dossier Pacing · Interconnection Spine), 2
merges (Rare-Artifact Determinism; Latent→Developed incl. Oracle close), the full
conflicts-with-resolutions (plate-depth → LAYUP wins; free "counts" struck; 0-100 internal-only;
accent artifact-vs-surround split; one warm token ramp + one base hex; warm-neutral wins;
glow keyed to RARE not PAID; Halo = mode not deeper-AI; + tensions incl. humor-off-safety,
one-rarity-axis, lens-7v10 deferred, forbidden-cross-as-validator, frozen colophon, static-card-
first, card-scoped mix-blend), and the build-now-vs-later split. Pull on demand; implements
nothing. This is the index for the whole research body.

## Magnetism Model v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/MAGNETISM_MODEL_V1.md` (RESEARCH; FILE_MAP registers it) from a 14-agent
White Death (8 Sonnet axes → 2 Haiku compulsion-sweep + 2 Opus magnetism/FIT judges → Opus
consolidate → Opus rank), bar = magnetism-not-compulsion (any exploit mechanic = instant kill).
22→8 CONFIDENT survivors, 8 killed. Definition (canon: GOLDEN_NUGGETS #7): pull by giving, not exploiting;
the operating copy-test = it dies the instant wording shifts from "this was partial / assigned
on Develop" to "unlock your score / you missed something better." The 8 survivors are all
copy/CSS framing of LIVE state (serial spine, archetype class made legible, latent→developed
law, filing-event row on Plate 01, Develop-as-chapter, oracle-as-close, room-as-place [static
light+grid], minted colophon) — i.e. the magnetism is already built, it just needs surfacing.
Notably killed BOTH money-gate hooks (the "in another timeline" oracle variant-window and the
future-framed sealed-stat tease) under the hard rule even though both scored STRONG. Pull on
demand; implements nothing. Completes the 6-doc scope spine (universe · free-paid · layup ·
layering · depth · magnetism).

## Depth + Interconnection Model v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/DEPTH_MODEL_V1.md` (RESEARCH; FILE_MAP registers it) from an 8-agent
White Death SCOUT (7 Sonnet over instill/interconnect/gloss → Opus FIT+ECHO rank), bar =
ECHO not accumulate, CONFIDENT/STRONG only (19→7 survivors, 14 killed). Finding: depth comes
from naming/enforcing connections already in the copy+data, on two backbones — **serial = the
photo-grounded person-neutral join key** (masked Free → revealed Halo already carries the
latent→developed physics) and **archetype class = the content axis** (class→family→lens→hidden-
stat governs what each surface says). Holds: the shared spine, the link grammar incl. the
**Two-Track Attachment Law** (photo→card READ on plates 01–05/07 vs declared-lore→serial FILE
on Plate 06; forbidden cross — the rule that lets zodiac/numerology attach without inference),
Codex(class-indexed)-vs-Journal(time-ordered), the gloss system (two-tier hover, Artifact-Test
destination, Oracle left mysterious), and 7 KEEP/High layers (serial spine, two-track law,
class→family axis, field-token through-thread, filing-event chain, sealed-stat payoff, gloss).
Pull on demand; implements nothing. Completes the 5-doc scope spine (universe · free-paid ·
layup · layering · depth).

## Layering Model v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/LAYERING_MODEL_V1.md` (RESEARCH; FILE_MAP registers it) from a
15-agent White Death SCOUT on layering (6 ground → Opus substrate → 6 scout → Opus
FIT-adversary → Opus rank), FIT as the bar. Finding: a more coherent universe = surfacing
seams that ALREADY exist in the data, connective-only (no detector, no new schema, no
grammar-bend). Holds the 4 priority seams (P1 archetype bridge: class→family→lens→hidden-
stat map; P2 provenance lineage: objectNo→scanId→serial through-line making Develop a
visible identity event; P3 evidence→stat→display closed loop: subject-lock=confidence,
receiptId→board entry; P4 single back-seam gate as the surface layers land on), 8 ranked
survivors (5 KEEP/High, 1 KEEP/Med, 2 DILUTE), the floating guardrails (person-drift /
detector-implying / backlog-zone / premature-enum kills), and a 30-seam latent-link index.
Pull on demand; implements nothing. Note: survivor #3 (route+status rows) also satisfies
the existing "Route label in Source Record" Ready item.

## Free / Paid Model v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/FREE_PAID_MODEL_V1.md` (RESEARCH; FILE_MAP registers it) from an
11-agent White Death on the free/paid question (4 grounded inspectors → Opus audit → 5
scouts → Opus rank). Finding: the boundary is sound (complete front / sealed back); the
defect is **tier-ladder FRAMING** on the menu compare-tiles, the in-room "Develops:" CTA,
and the 7× ARCHIVE-PULL plate tags — which is why Free reads as the raw leftover. Holds:
the sharpened question (affordance+copy, not what's gated), 5 decision-axes (design /
data kind-vs-amount / visual complete-but-matte / funnel-timing / per-zone one-gate), the
model shortlist (KEEP front/back; the user's raw→structured instinct folds in as DILUTE;
3 kills incl. "same data re-skinned"), a concrete 5-step MENU FIX, and native analogies
(contact-sheet vs finished print; TCG base + holo + first-edition stamp). The menu fix is
the recommended first pull (restyle/recopy only, upholds the locked model). Pull on
demand; implements nothing.

## Universe Map v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/UNIVERSE_MAP_V1.md` (RESEARCH; FILE_MAP registers it) from a White
Death pass (Phase A audit of the "universe" vision + Phase B scout, 6 cheap scouts +
Opus bar-holder). Verdict: the win is **one "Archive" universe → flat zone-map (Lobby ·
Scan Room · Card Record · Vault · Codex) → latent↔developed flip as physics**, all
CSS/SVG/light-JS (no WebGL/slob). Killed the literal 3D / world-above-below / flipped
worlds / per-stat realms / game-fantasy tone. Holds the verdict table + a fast/no-slob
inspiration map per surviving concept (Obra Dinn manifest = vault+card-record+flip in
one; Cooper Hewitt/Louvre/Wellcome = vault; Pentiment SVG zone-graph + Museum Department
frame + CSS view-timeline HUD = zones; clip-path develop wipe + CSS card-flip +
view-transitions = flip/card-record). Pull on demand; implements nothing. Flags the
open follow-on: how Free/Paid lines cut across the universe.

## Layup / Around-the-Card Redesign Research v1 (2026-06-14, docs only — research)

Saved `docs/research/LAYUP_RESEARCH_V1.md` (RESEARCH authority — informs, never
implements; FILE_MAP registers it) from a 9-agent layup-research workflow run against
the user's verbatim design feedback (card + diagram are the keepers; Source feels
redundant; Metrics too dull; everything around the card is dull; wants non-obvious
moves, a real nav/button frame, and the technical lines de-emphasized). Governing
principle: **"the room is a ruled instrument sheet; the card is the only object on
it"** — de-dull the surroundings via structure / numbering / line-weight / type /
rhythm, **never** depth/glow/material (which would steal card primacy / read
soft-SaaS). Holds: flatness budgets (depth = card only; accent = lines + the one
Oracle-edge moment; motion = transform/opacity/clip-path), do/don't, **5 ranked
tasks** (Dim technical lines → Buttons+rail → Right+dossier de-dull → Source merge →
Metrics redesign — each leverage/risk/effort + done-when), per-surface specs, the
dim-technical-lines treatment (step DOWN a tier, keep every datum), and a non-obvious
pattern bank (oscilloscope ticks, blueprint leaders, banknote micro-rule, museum
labels, datasheet § breaks, mission-control header, blueprint grid, rotated chapter
index, spectrum-analyzer bars). **Pull on demand** — each task graduates via the
normal pre-edit critique, one commit behind `baseline-v1`. No runtime change.

## Engineered Technique Pass v1 — #1 Card corner-shape edge (2026-06-14 / BR-S037, styles.css)

Ranked build program from the deep-scout research (5 web-standard techniques;
**one technique = one commit** for granular revert against `baseline-v1`). **#1 of 5:
CSS `corner-shape` chamfered card corners.** Added an `@supports(corner-shape: bevel)`
block setting `corner-shape: bevel` on `.card` / `.card__plate` / `.card__plate::before`
— the master card now reads as a machined-cut object on every treatment; browsers
without `corner-shape` keep the square 12px radius. **Restyle-not-relayout:**
border-radius magnitude and card box dimensions are unchanged (verified live: card
440×~722, `corner-shape:bevel` computed, console clean; chamfer confirmed via
headless-Edge screenshots at 1×/2×). Additive — revert = delete the block (or
`git checkout baseline-v1 -- styles.css`). **Remaining ranked (each its own commit):**
#2 scroll-driven dossier reveal · #3 `@property` stat-band fill · #4 SVG line-draw
(Diagram) · #5 pointer spotlight (Lab) — #4/#5 held pending a visual/value check.

## Revert Playbook + baseline-v1 tag (2026-06-14, docs only + git tag)

Added `docs/REVERT_PLAYBOOK.md` (FILE_MAP registers it) so "revert / roll back /
undo / go back to before X" is unambiguous and self-locating: the three restore-point
kinds (named `baseline-*` tags · per-task commits indexed by this CHANGE_MAP +
TASK_QUEUE · the working tree), a symptom→target→command table for SPOTTING what to
revert, when each git command is safe (`git revert` preferred on main; `checkout
<tag> -- <file>` for file restore; `reset --hard` destructive/branch-only), and the
pre-big-change ritual (tag a `baseline-vN` + push, or branch `experiment/<name>`,
prefer additive-behind-Lab, one idea = one commit). Also stamped the annotated git
tag **`baseline-v1` → `9a5ffb0`** (pushed) = the state before the shiny-technique
experiments. No runtime change.

## Three Shiny Material Prototypes v1 (2026-06-14 / BR-S036, data.js + app.js + styles.css)

Built the CARD_TECH_LAB §20 / TASK_QUEUE Ready #0 prototype: three controlled
card-finish studies — **Cold Foil · Black Star · Night Gloss** — switchable in the
**Lab state** for screenshot comparison. **No new tier, no new reading, no Halo
Dossier, no payment/AI/backend/upload, no layout change.** Pre-task critique = a
2-agent Opus panel (sequencing/scope + design/mechanism/taste) → GO_WITH_CHANGES.

- **Mechanism — `data-lab-material` overlay, NOT a new `data-treatment`.** A new
  treatment value would crash the unconditional `TREATMENTS[treatment]` /
  `t.rarity` lookup in `renderCard` and force churn across gating/stateBadge/
  toggle/keyboard/18-state matrix (CHANGE_MAP "To add a new treatment"). The
  overlay restyles only the Lab (`mint`) card; `state.treatment` stays
  {free,mint,shiny}, so gating, the 18-state matrix, free, and the paid Halo path
  are all untouched. (Divergence from §20 #4's literal "new data-treatment skin"
  is named in CARD_TECH_LAB §20.)
- **data.js:** new copy-only `LAB_MATERIALS` constant (3 `{key,label,note}`
  finish presets, ordered = cycle order). Finish names describe the card SURFACE,
  never the person. Parallels TREATMENTS/STAT_LABELS/FORMULAS — no score/stat/
  reading/derivation.
- **app.js:** `state.labMaterial` (default null = Signature Mint silver); a
  guarded `?lab=cold-foil|black-star|night-gloss` deep link that applies **only
  when `t=mint`** (and does not, alone, open the room); a Lab-only `[` / `]`
  keyboard cycle (signature → cold-foil → black-star → night-gloss → signature);
  `renderCard` sets `data-lab-material` + a one-slot finish label
  ("LAB STATE · Cold Foil") **only when `treatment==="mint"`**; `labMaterial`
  resets to null on any switch to free/shiny (keyboard F/H/S + the toggle/goto
  click handlers). Free/shiny `renderCard` output is byte-identical to before.
- **styles.css:** 3 finish skins keyed `.card[data-treatment="mint"][data-lab-material="…"]`
  (mint-only by selector construction). **100% static** — each neutralizes the
  inherited mint `.photo__shimmer` sweep (`animation:none`), so no new animated
  selector and no `prefers-reduced-motion` edit needed. Distinct material BASE per
  finish (icy foil / black-chrome+constellation-grain / near-black glass);
  per-source `--halo-*` used for accent only; glow is a tight box-shadow (no
  large-area `filter:blur`); only background/box-shadow/existing layers touched →
  geometry LOCKED.
- **Scope discipline:** rendered on the **Lab (`mint`) state only**, never on the
  live paid `shiny` Halo. **No winner picked, no DECISION_LOG/PROJECT_OS
  promotion** — that stays with the separate Backlog item *Final Halo material
  decision*; a provisional non-binding lean (Black Star / Night Gloss) is recorded
  in CARD_TECH_LAB §20.
- **Verified live** (DOM + computed-style; the headless screenshot tool times out
  on this project): all 3 finishes apply only at `t=mint` with distinct material
  bases + "LAB STATE · <finish>" label + static shimmer; `t=free` and `t=shiny`
  ignore `lab` (free/shiny unchanged); base `t=mint` (no lab) unchanged; `[`/`]`
  cycles + wraps and `f` exits Lab clearing the overlay; **geometry locked** (card
  440×~721, head 28, label single-line — identical across all finishes + free +
  shiny); the Artifact Archetype module still renders in Lab; all 4 `?dev` routes
  + bare menu unchanged; console clean.

## Render Archetype Discovery Note v1 (2026-06-14 / BR-S035, app.js + data.js + COPY_SYSTEM §4)

Rendered the Halo **archetype discovery note** that the PROJECT_OS §10 visibility
table promised ("Archetype — Halo Mint: full archetype explanation + discovery
note") but which had **no data field and no render** anywhere in the running room.
**Copy-surfacing only — no new analysis system, no schema/score/derivation, no
Halo Dossier, no payment/AI/backend/upload, no redesign.**

- **data.js:** new copy-only constant `ARCHETYPE_NOTES`, keyed by archetype
  **class** (matches `V2_EXTRAS.archetypeClass`) — 2 entries (The Encounter / The
  Dispatch), each `{ line, discovery }` taken from `COPY_SYSTEM §4` (the
  one-liner + the discovery note). Parallels the existing `TREATMENTS` /
  `STAT_LABELS` / `FORMULAS` constants; **no per-source field, no `V2_EXTRAS` /
  `toScanResultV2` / ScanResult-v2 change.**
- **app.js:** new **"Artifact Archetype"** module in `renderReadingPanel`,
  **developed states only** — prepended to the existing `!free` `deep` string, so
  the one existing gate covers both mint + shiny (no new conditional). Looks up
  the note by `getScanResult(src).archetype.class`; **omits the module entirely**
  when the v2 scan/class is absent or unmapped (no instance-title fallback, no
  "undefined"). Order: head "Artifact Archetype" → class chip
  "Artifact class · The Encounter/Dispatch" → one-liner → discovery note (italic
  pulled-quote) → scope caption "artifact archetype · a photo role, not a
  person". **Zero new CSS** (reuses `.module` / `moduleHead` / `.aura` /
  `.aura__chip` / `.module__line` / `.module__line--fit` / `.metriccap`).
- **Free unchanged:** the card still shows the per-source **instance** archetype
  label (`renderCard`) — Free stays complete ("label only"); **no** locked/teaser
  module added (would manufacture a "missing result" hole, PROJECT_OS §10).
- **Anti-drift framing:** the governing noun ("Artifact"/"class") is bound to
  **both** the module header and the chip so it reads as a *photo role, not a
  personality type*; every rendered line's grammatical subject is the
  photo/image/artifact/class (five-gate / Artifact-Test clean).
- **COPY_SYSTEM §4 sub-fix (surgical, one line):** the canon "The Encounter"
  discovery note "The image does not let **you** observe. It answers." →
  "The image does not **wait to be** observed. It answers." (de-second-personed;
  dated retirement note appended) so shipped copy and canon match — same shape as
  the BR-S034 §6 "for you"→"for the lens" fix. No other §4 archetype or §6 touched.
- **Right-panel chosen deliberately:** the TASK_QUEUE Done-when alternative
  "dossier §4/§5" would require building the Halo Dossier, which
  `HALO_GATE_BOUNDARY §D` marks "define; do NOT build", and the dossier is
  hard-capped at 7 plates (DECISION_LOG). So the right-panel render is in-scope by
  spec, not deferred dossier work. The card content list is LOCKED (PROJECT_OS §7).
- **Pre-edit critique:** a 5-agent adversarial workflow (coherence / personality-
  drift / copy-safety / UI-fit / data-shape) returned **GO_WITH_CHANGES**; all
  mandatory changes applied (header word "Artifact Archetype", noun-bound chip,
  cleaner Encounter rewrite, `.module__line--fit` quote class, null/unknown-class
  guard, verbatim shipped scope caption).
- **Verified live** (1600×900): the module renders on src1 (The Encounter) / src2
  (The Dispatch) × shiny × source+metrics with the exact copy + italic pulled-
  quote + mono scope caption; **absent in Free** (card instance label intact); no
  public 0–100 in the module; `?dev=free-scan-sim` / `halo-gate` /
  `uploaded-result` / `uploaded-blocked` + bare menu unchanged; normal Local Draft
  → Develop Scan code path untouched (sealed/offline); console clean.

## data.js Copy System Audit v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S034, audit + 3 small fixes)

Audited **all** sample-card copy in `data.js` against `docs/COPY_SYSTEM.md` +
the research human-in-frame / language rules (image-as-artifact five-gate, no
second-person, no gender/identity, no status/personality/attractiveness, BLUE
ROOM voice, every-outcome-is-a-win). **Verdict PASS WITH FIXES.** New audit doc
`docs/audits/DATA_COPY_SYSTEM_AUDIT_V1.md` (FILE_MAP registers it). Method: two
token-greps over data.js + an independent adversarial sub-agent over every
string field; both converged. **Confirmed:** 0 occurrences of `you/your`, 0
gendered pronouns (he/she), 0 banned status/beauty/SaaS words in any visible
reading; every-outcome-is-a-win holds. **3 small fixes (no logic change):**
(1) `data.js` SRC-01 statNote "…tax the **score**" → "…tax the **composition**"
(the one place prose treated a stat as a grade, threatening §5); (2) `data.js`
internal `archetype.routeLogic` "**dominant** stat pair" → "**strongest** stat
pair" (non-rendered, defense-in-depth before any v2 surface ships); (3)
`docs/COPY_SYSTEM.md` §6 canon "Nothing here performs **for you**." → "…was
performed **for the lens**." (the governing tone-benchmark still enshrined the
exact "for you" the prior audit retired from shipped copy). Borderline-kept
(documented): Disarming/Grounding (Frame Impact labels), "motion potential",
fitMatrix "Locked" state, "posture of someone who decides", "beard", the
confidence-band diagnostic, the group-chat oracle joke. **Verified live**:
data.js parses; 4 representative states render with tier bands; fix #1 renders;
all 4 dev routes + bare menu unchanged; Local Draft → Develop Scan still
sealed/offline; console clean. No redesign / new features / Halo Dossier /
payment / AI / backend / upload analysis.

## Sample Room 18-State Audit v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S033, audit + 4 copy fixes)

Audited the full sample-room state matrix (2 sources × free/halo/lab × source/
diagram/metrics = 18 states) after Artifact Language Stabilization Pack v1.
**Verdict PASS WITH FIXES.** New audit doc
`docs/audits/SAMPLE_ROOM_18_STATE_AUDIT_V1.md` (FILE_MAP registers it). Method:
live route-walk at 1600×900 (per-state DOM sweep: stat labels, tier bands,
leaked-term regex, 0–100-on-stat-surfaces, diamond label bbox, clipped-band,
banned-language, console) + screenshot + an independent five-gate copy-safety
sub-agent. **Migration confirmed fully correct** across all 18 states: every
public stat shows Frame Presence / Frame / Signal / Scene Charge as tier bands
(Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/Peak); hidden = Gesture Geometry / Field Silence;
deep module = Frame Impact; evidence = ↑/↓ arrows; **no standalone Presence/
Charge/Visual Impact/Gesture Authority/Dominant, no public 0–100 stat score, no
±N delta, no diamond overflow, no clipped tier labels** anywhere. The kept
Metrics-tab numeric diagnostics are the documented "interpretive formula, not a
measurement" exception; the `?dev=uploaded-result` harness keeps legacy labels
(NOT USER SCAN exception). All routes regression-clean (menu + 4 dev routes +
Local Draft → Develop Scan sealed/offline; console clean). **4 copy fixes
(data.js, prose only — pre-existing, not migration-introduced):** SRC-02 stance
"…neither does **he**." → "…the frame doesn't pretend otherwise."; SRC-02
statNote "…**he** accepts the terms." → "…the silhouette accepts the terms.";
SRC-02 hidden.read "…performed **for you**." → "…for the lens."; SRC-01 latent
evidence "…straight **at you**." → "…straight at the lens." (legacy
`d.evidence` branch is unreachable — fixed for defense-in-depth). No
code/logic change; no redesign / new features / Halo Dossier / payment / AI /
backend / upload analysis.

## Halo Gate Ethics Audit v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S032, audit + 1 copy fix)

Audited the `?dev=halo-gate` mock + the migrated `?dev=free-scan-sim` sealed-back
copy against `docs/halo/HALO_GATE_BOUNDARY_V1.md` — ethics, boundary compliance,
manipulation risk, artifact-safety. **Verdict PASS.** New audit doc
`docs/audits/HALO_GATE_ETHICS_AUDIT_V1.md` (FILE_MAP registers it). Method: live
DOM text-sweep + screenshot of the rendered pages (not code-only) + an
independent adversarial five-gate / anti-manipulation review of every visible
string (PASS). Confirmed: **no exact pre-unlock counts** (zero numbers on the
gate; no "image lever"/"target variant"/"receipts found"/"Map exists"/"setup
card sealed" on either route), **Free Pull still reads complete**, **Halo does
not imply a hidden real score** ("added depth, not a hidden result" / "Halo is
the sealed back, not a hidden score"), **dev-mock/not-payment/not-real-analysis**
(disabled CTA + rail + footer), no manipulation, no person-truth; regression
clean (uploaded-result/blocked + menu unchanged, Local Draft → Develop Scan still
sealed/offline, console clean). **One low fix applied** (copy only): the Free
Pull halo-edge note `Open the back later` → **`The front is already complete`**
(it read as a bare "result continues later" invite on the front, without the
gate's neutralizer; the new line affirms free-completeness). No redesign, no new
features, no Halo Dossier, no payment/AI/backend/upload analysis.

## Halo Gate Dev Mock v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S031, app.js + styles.css)

Added a dev-only **sealed card-back / dossier chamber** mock at **`?dev=halo-gate`**,
bound by `docs/halo/HALO_GATE_BOUNDARY_V1.md`. **Not payment · not unlock · not
AI/backend/upload analysis · not a real user result** — it shows ZERO analysis
data, only the sealed-back metaphor + qualitative depth hints. New
`renderHaloGateMock()` (mounted via `mountDev` when `state.dev === "halo-gate"`;
the dev allowlist now includes `halo-gate`). Layout: a landscape graded slab —
**left** = sealed dark back-plate (no photo; "BACK FACE · ARCHIVED · DOSSIER
LAYER · HELD IN CONSERVATION", a material conservation-seal mark + one restrained
shimmer/weld), **right** = dossier gate panel (kicker "◆ HALO DOSSIER", title
"THE BACK OF THIS CARD IS SEALED", subtitle "The Free Pull is yours. The back is
still closed.", three **qualitative** seal rows "Production notes sealed / Variant
routes sealed / Back face archived · conservation seal intact", a Free-complete
reassurance line, a **disabled** "Open Halo Dossier · dev mock — no payment" CTA +
a "Keep Free Pull" decline, and the artifact scope/safety line). A persistent rail
**"DEV MOCK · NOT PAYMENT · NOT REAL ANALYSIS"** + a foot reiterating Free stays
complete / Halo is the sealed back not a hidden score. **No exact locked counts,
no numbers, no module inventory, no urgency/chance/loot-box/person-truth.**
styles.css adds the `.halogate*` block (tokens only; one material shimmer +
sealed weld) + a narrow-screen stack rule.

Also **migrated the Free Pull mock's vault** (`renderFreePullMock`, the
boundary's §G known-gap): the old enumerated count line *"Map exists — 2 image
levers · 2 target variants · setup card sealed"* + the `01/02` named-module rows
are replaced by a single **qualitative** sealed-back block — "Sealed back · in
conservation · This card has a sealed back. The dossier layer is archived —
additional production notes held in conservation. · Back face sealed · opens with
Halo." (removed the now-unused lever/variant count computation). **Verified live**
(1600×900): `?dev=halo-gate` renders the sealed-back mock with all dev labels, no
counts/numbers, disabled CTA; `?dev=free-scan-sim` no longer shows exact counts
and stays polished (Checkpoint Wave, tier bands, chips intact); `?dev=uploaded-result`
/ `?dev=uploaded-blocked` unchanged; bare URL → menu; normal Local Draft → Develop
Scan sealed/offline (renderGate/renderDraft intact); console clean. No
AI/backend/payment/upload analysis; runtime change limited to dev/mock routes +
the one Free-front vault copy line.

## Halo Gate Boundary Lock v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S030, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/halo/HALO_GATE_BOUNDARY_V1.md` (225 lines) — locks the
honest Free/Halo boundary before any Halo UI. **Free Pull = complete card
front; Halo = sealed card back / dossier layer** of the same card (additive
artifact depth, never a hidden "real score" / re-roll / rarity chase).
**Headline decision (LOCKED): the Free Pull front and the pre-unlock Halo Gate
must NOT show exact locked counts** ("2 image levers · 2 target variants · 6
receipts found") — they read as a *withheld inventory* and make the complete
card feel like a teaser. Use **qualitative sealed-back language** ("Sealed back ·
archived", "Back face held in conservation", "A dossier layer exists"); exact
counts/contents only **post-unlock**. Honesty preserved — the back genuinely
exists; we drop quantification, not truthfulness. Halo must be desirable via
artifact depth, never fake urgency / chance / loot-box / subscription-trap /
person-truth. The doc defines: product frame · Free Pull boundary (+ the
exact-count ban table) · Halo Gate boundary (forbidden list) · Halo Dossier
boundary (7 candidate modules as *production notes*, framing law — not built) ·
a copy bank (sealed-back hint / gate title+subtitle / disabled CTA / safety /
dev-route label) · anti-patterns (+ why) · implementation consequence for *Halo
Gate Dev Mock v1*. **Supersedes** the pre-unlock count guidance in
`HALO_GATE_UPGRADE_LAYUP_V1` §4/§5/§7/§11 and `FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1`
§8 (rest of both specs stands; named, not silently contradicted).
**Docs only — runtime unchanged**: the current `?dev=free-scan-sim` mock still
renders the "2 image levers · 2 target variants" vault line; that is now a
**known boundary gap**, migrated to qualitative copy in *Halo Gate Dev Mock v1*
(not here). DECISION_LOG (2026-06-13) + FILE_MAP register it; TASK_QUEUE binds
the next mock task and adds a *Halo Gate Ethics Audit* after it. No
AI/backend/payment/upload-analysis; no fake user analysis.

## Artifact Language Stabilization Pack v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S029, runtime + Core Change docs)

Migrated the **sample room's** visible artifact language (Sample Room Tier
Migration v1 + language/banned sweep). **Display-only** stat changes — internal
data keys (`presence/frame/signal/charge`) are unchanged; renamed at the render
layer via new app.js `STAT_LABELS` + `tierBand()`:
- **Stat labels:** Presence→**Frame Presence**, Charge→**Scene Charge** (Frame/
  Signal kept) across card miniStat, metrics diamond, Stat Reading, Stat
  Dossier, FORMULAS, Frame Impact/Lore modules. Hidden stat Gesture Authority→
  **Gesture Geometry**; "Visual Impact" module→**Frame Impact**.
- **No public 0–100:** the 4 public stat scores now show as **tier bands**
  (Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/Peak) on card/Stat Reading/Stat Dossier/Frame
  Impact/Lore/Hidden/Fit+Aura; bars + diamond geometry kept (diamond axis labels
  are names only, viewBox widened to fit + font bumped — label-fit, not a
  redesign). Evidence-board receipt deltas `+N`/`-N`→`↑/↓`.
- **Tier ladder:** dev-sim `FP_TIER_LADDER` and scan-contract `publicStats`
  migrated to Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/Peak (kills the rendered "Dominant").
- **Banned-language sweep** (data.js): "confidence in the kneel"→"commitment",
  Affect Trace/Smile→"Expression Band", aura Unhurried/Methodical→Idle-Engine/
  Slow-Burn, fitMatrix "Person"→"Subject", "route has standards"→softened,
  "scene ownership"→"scene anchoring", hidden read personification removed.
- **Dev fixture coherence:** `validFreeSimulationResult` reframeMap/freeSummary/
  receipt residue cleaned to the Checkpoint Wave / Signal Bearer / Day Print
  front (displayed lever/variant counts 2/2 preserved).

**Intentional carve-outs (documented in-code + DECISION_LOG):** the dev-only
`?dev=uploaded-result`/`uploaded-blocked` renderer harness keeps legacy labels +
0–100 + `+N` deltas (strictly dev, "NOT USER SCAN"); the Metrics-tab interpretive
diagnostics (signal mix, composition pressure, fit matrix, subject-lock) keep
numeric weights ("interpretive formula, not a measurement", not the 4 public
scores).

**Core Change Review (LOCKED §7/§9):** DECISION_LOG (2026-06-13) supersedes the
"keep Presence/Frame/Signal/Charge" + show-as-numbers decisions and **ratifies
one authoritative public tier ladder — Muted/Clean/Strong/Charged/Peak** —
reconciled into `CARD_LOGIC_V1` §2 (supersedes QUIET/PRESENT/STRONG/DOMINANT/
TOTAL and the FREE_PULL §7 recommendation; §6 trigger floors read by ordinal
mapping). PROJECT_OS §7/§9/§10, SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC, COPY_SYSTEM §6, and README
updated to match. **Verified live** (1600×900): sample SRC-01/02 × free/halo ×
all 3 tabs show tier bands + renamed labels, no public 0–100, diamond labels
fit, evidence arrows, Gesture Geometry; `?dev=free-scan-sim` migrated (Frame
Presence/Scene Charge + Muted…Peak) and still Checkpoint Wave; uploaded-result/
uploaded-blocked preserved; menu + Develop-gate intact; console clean.
Adversarial 3-agent review (regression/safety/scope): code PASS, govced docs
applied. **No new product features; no AI/backend/payment/Halo/upload analysis;
no layout/slab redesign.**

## Free Pull Layout Mock v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S027, app.js + styles.css)

The dev-only Free Scan Simulation route (`?dev=free-scan-sim`) is now the first
screenshot-worthy **Free Pull front** per `docs/FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1.md`
— a single **landscape graded-slab artifact**, not a report stack. **Dev sim
only · no AI · no user-photo analysis · no payment · no Halo unlock.**
`renderUploadedScanResultDev` gains one early branch — `if (sim) return
renderFreePullMock(result);` **after** the validator/blocked path — so an
invalid sim fixture still renders the safe blocked state, and the
`?dev=uploaded-result` / `?dev=uploaded-blocked` routes keep the **original
layout untouched** (verified: no `.fpcard`, original `.uploadeddev__card`, 8
stat rows + flags plate; blocked route still shows the blocked panel). New
`renderFreePullMock()` builds: a slim **persistent dev rail** (DEV SIMULATION ·
NOT REAL ANALYSIS · NOT USER SCAN — not a giant warning block); an **image slab
window** (~52%, left) using `SOURCES[0]` as a clearly-labelled **sample dev
stand-in** (the fixture carries no photo) with the existing photoTuning/material,
a tiny `FREE PULL · DEV SIM` edition stamp, artifact title + quiet **ARTIFACT
ID**; and a **certification label** (~48%, right) with the archetype teaser
("a photo role, not a person"), **4 public tier rows as segmented notches**
(Presence/Frame/Signal/Visual Impact — bands from a local display ladder
**Quiet/Present/Strong/Sharp/Dominant**, derived from the public bar count so
**no 0–100 number leaks**), **2 grounded receipt chips** (`observed cue →
artifact effect`, contact-sheet annotations), a **shape-only sealed vault**
("in conservation": 01 Sealed Stat name+structural reason **no tier**; 02
Reframe Map **counts only** — "2 image levers · 2 target variants · setup card
sealed", **no lever/variant/setup contents** — fixing the old sim, which leaked
the full Reframe Map on Free), a quiet **scope line**, and a calm **Halo seal
edge** ("This card has a sealed back · Halo dossier sealed" — not a button
stack). styles.css adds the `.fpwrap` / `.fprail` / `.fpcard*` block (tokens
only; one restrained material shimmer + a sealed-slab weld seam; the card is the
only object with depth per DESIGN_TOKENS) + a narrow-screen stack rule.

**Local tier-display ladder is dev-route-only** (Quiet/Present/Strong/Sharp/
Dominant) — it does NOT rewrite `CARD_LOGIC_V1` §2; *Sample Room Tier Migration
v1* still owns the authoritative public band reconcile. **Verified live**
(`?dev=free-scan-sim`): one landscape artifact at 1600×900 (1364×513, ~7% side
margin) and 1920×1080 (image dominates, 52/48 split, fits height); rail +
footer carry all three dev labels; tier bands Sharp/Strong/Present/Dominant; 2
cue→effect chips; vault shape-only (no Reframe contents leaked); scope + Halo
edge present; no public 0–100 numbers; forbidden-lexicon sweep clean; console
clean. `?dev=uploaded-result` + `?dev=uploaded-blocked` + bare-URL menu
unchanged. **Normal flow untouched** (zero edits to renderMenu/renderDraft/
renderGate/draft wiring): Local Draft → Develop Scan still opens the sealed
engine-offline gate; uploaded photos still produce no analysis. (Screenshot
pipeline unchanged — the dev route needs an explicit `?dev` query; verified via
DOM/geometry inspection as the preview screenshot tool was timing out.)

## Free Pull Screenshot Layout Spec v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S026, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/FREE_PULL_SCREENSHOT_LAYOUT_V1.md` (244 lines) — defines
the **front of the Free Pull card** as a **Split Artifact / Stat Board**:
one landscape, PC-first card object, image ~48% near-fullbleed (the image *is*
the card) + artifact title + tiny print/serial/Free Pull badge on the left;
archetype teaser, **4 public tier-band stats** (Presence/Frame/Signal/**Visual
Impact**, bars not 0–100 numbers), **2 grounded receipt chips** (`observed cue
→ artifact effect`), a **sealed vault** (01 Sealed Stat name+structural reason
no tier · 02 Reframe Map *shape/count only* — never expands on Free), a quiet
**scope line**, and a calm **Halo seal edge** (artifact edge, not a SaaS button
stack) on the right. Adds screenshot rules (all of: image · archetype · 4
bands · 2 chips · vault shape · scope · Halo edge in one shot), a hard content
budget (no paragraphs / ≤2–3 chips / short labels), receipt grammar (good +
banned), sealed-vault grammar, anti-goals, and **mock acceptance criteria** for
the next task. **Roadmap correction recorded:** the front is specified *before*
the Halo back (the sealed back) is mocked — corrected order is Free Pull Layout
Mock v1 → Sample Room Tier Migration v1 → Halo Gate Dev Mock v1. **Spec Change
Review (slim):** §7 recommends a screenshot-facing band ladder **Quiet · Set ·
Strong · Sharp · Dominant** that **diverges from `CARD_LOGIC_V1` §2**
(QUIET/PRESENT/STRONG/DOMINANT/TOTAL); the conflict is **named, not picked
silently** — the spec explicitly does NOT override §2, and flags reconciliation
to *Sample Room Tier Migration v1* (which also migrates the legacy sample-room
Charge/0–100 display per `PROJECT_OS` §7/§9). **Docs only — runtime unchanged**
(no app.js/scan-contract.js/data.js/index.html/styles.css edits; no AI/backend/
upload analysis/payment/Halo unlock/runtime mock). FILE_MAP registers it. No
LOCKED safety rule relaxed.

## Halo Gate / Upgrade Layup v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S025, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/HALO_GATE_UPGRADE_LAYUP_V1.md` (284 lines) — designs
the Halo upgrade as a **sealed-dossier ritual, not a SaaS paywall**, with
no payment implemented. Core law: Free Pull is complete; Halo opens the
**back of the same card** (the user opens a dossier on a card they already
hold — never a reroll, gamble, or rarity chase). Defines: upgrade **timing**
(gate appears only after the Free Pull fully lands; never an interrupt
before value); the **gate layout** (a card-back/sealed chamber with sealed
stat / Reframe-Map / evidence / oracle / mint envelopes showing *shape*, not
contents; CTA "Open Halo Dossier", decline "Keep Free Pull"); **Free preview
vs Halo content**; **sealed-stat** presentation (structural reason, no tier);
the **Reframe-Map envelope** ("3 image levers · 2 target variants · setup
card sealed" — no near-miss language); **per-scan price framing** (one-time,
this card only; no subscription/packs/credits/blind purchase — no price
picked, no checkout); **ethical decline** (no confirmshaming/nags);
**post-unlock reveal rhythm** (calm archival sequence, no slot-machine/
chest/confetti); a hard **dark-pattern ban list**; and a **copy library**
(20 headings, 20 CTA/support, 20 decline, 20 Reframe envelope, 20 sealed
teaser, 10 reveal). **Docs only — runtime unchanged** (no app.js/
scan-contract.js/data.js/index.html/styles.css edits; no payment/checkout).
FILE_MAP registers it. Feeds *Halo Gate Dev Mock v1*. No LOCKED safety rule
relaxed.

## Card System Fixture Upgrade v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S024, scan-contract.js + app.js + styles.css)

The dev-only Free Scan Simulation (`?dev=free-scan-sim`) now reflects
CARD_SYSTEM_V1 + CARD_LOGIC_V1 — **dev fixture only, no AI, no user-photo
analysis**. `DEV_FIXTURES.validFreeSimulationResult` gained future-facing
fields (still passes the unchanged validator): **publicStats** (label/tier/
bars/receiptId — public TIER bands, the card shows tiers/bars, never exact
0–100; internal numbers kept for sorting but never printed), **grounded
receipts** (added `observedCue`/`artifactEffect` alongside the
validator-required lens/observation/visibleCue/effect/confidence), a
**scopeLine**, a **sealedStat** (label/teaser/reasonType — sealed, no value
shown), **rarity** (band/print/reason + a quality-neutral note that avoids
the forbidden lexicon), and a **reframeMap** (current / whyThisCard /
levers / setupCard — image-setup changes only, no near-miss or
self-improvement language). `renderUploadedScanResultDev` renders tier rows
(tonal 5-seg bar), grounded "cue → effect" receipts, and scope/sealed/
rarity/Reframe panels — all **gated on field presence**, so
`?dev=uploaded-result` is pixel-identical and `?dev=uploaded-blocked` still
blocks. The **validator was not weakened** (SCHEMA_KEYS / FORBIDDEN_TERMS /
scanForbidden unchanged; the upgraded fixture passes, invalid fixtures still
fail). styles.css adds `.uploadeddev__tier*` / `__scope` / `__ground` /
`__seal*` / `__rarity*` / `__lever`/`__setup` (tokens only). **Normal flow
untouched**: Develop Scan still opens the sealed engine-offline gate;
uploaded photos still produce nothing; sample room + deep links verified
unchanged; console clean. Adversarial review (safety / validator /
preservation / UX): 3 low findings, all fixed (plate-order restore for
uploaded-result, tonal tier bars, sealed-header wrap). Dev sim needs an
explicit query — not in the screenshot pipeline.

## Executable Card Logic v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S023, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/CARD_LOGIC_V1.md` (223 lines) — turns CARD_SYSTEM_V1
into a hidden ruleset so cards read rule-driven, not "vibe text with fake
precision". Defines: **public tier bands** (QUIET/PRESENT/STRONG/DOMINANT/
TOTAL — cards show tiers/bars, never exact 0–100; DOMINANT explicitly
guarded against person/alpha dominance) with a *provisional* internal→public
mapping; **two-layer receipt grounding** (`[observed cue] → [artifact
effect]`, no Tier 2 without Tier 1); detected cue categories; the **Artifact
Test as an executable line check** (sentence subject must be an image
element, never the person); **trigger rules for all 24 archetypes** (Primary
/ Cue / Lenses / Block / Tie-break) + the 3 risky ones held; **sealed-stat
logic** (5 reason types, never always the highest); **rarity logic**
(unusual artifact profile, never better-human; 6 provisional bands);
**Reframe Map** (image changes only — never "look/dress/be better");
**low-information ladder** (8 safe special-card types + a blocked path for
face-rating bait); **voice-register rotation** + house-phrase watchlist; and
**validator targets**. **Docs only — runtime unchanged** (no
app.js/scan-contract.js/data.js/index.html/styles.css edits). FILE_MAP
registers it. Feeds *Card System Fixture Upgrade v1*. No LOCKED safety rule
relaxed.

## Card System Spec v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S022, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_V1.md` (333 lines) — the official card
creative system: the Artifact Test ("if a different photo of the same
person could change the score it is an artifact signal; if it sticks to the
person it is banned"), final v1 stats (Free-front: Presence/Frame/Signal/
Visual Impact · Halo-depth: Charge/Lore Density/Fit Coherence/**Gesture
Geometry**/Setting Gravity/Artifact Coherence — "Stance Read"/"Gesture
Authority" renamed to Gesture Geometry), 10 lenses, 24 safe archetypes in 5
families (3 risky ones held for later; "The Beautiful Contradiction"
renamed "The Striking Contradiction" — "beautiful" is banned beauty-app
language), receipt rules + 20 safe examples, Free vs Halo output shape, and
BLUE ROOM tone (20 approved + 20 banned patterns, 20 Free / 20 Halo / 10
oracle lines), plus the global forbidden-language list. **Docs only —
runtime unchanged** (no app.js/scan-contract.js/data.js/index.html/styles.css
edits). Spec Change Review: the v1 stat taxonomy refines `SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC`
(Charge → Halo, Visual Impact → Free front, +Setting Gravity/Artifact
Coherence); the shipped fixtures still use the prior set and migrate in the
next task. `FILE_MAP` registers the spec. No LOCKED safety rule relaxed.

## Free Scan Simulation v1 — Dev Only (2026-06-13 / BR-S021, app.js + scan-contract.js + styles.css)

A third dev-only route `?dev=free-scan-sim` (alongside `uploaded-result` /
`uploaded-blocked`) that previews the **future Free Scan rhythm** — dev
fixture only, **no AI, no user-photo analysis**. `mountDev()` loads the new
`DEV_FIXTURES.validFreeSimulationResult` (a FREE-tier result: 4 visible
stats, limited receipts, free summary, no Halo-only fields — passes the
validator) and calls `renderUploadedScanResultDev(result, { mode:
"free-scan-sim" })`. Sim mode adds a triple-labelled banner (DEV SIMULATION
· NOT REAL ANALYSIS · NOT USER SCAN), a "FREE SCAN SIMULATION · DEV ONLY"
heading, and a **static** 3-step stepper (Local draft staged → Scan
development simulated → Free result preview — no progress bar implying real
processing), each step carrying one of the three labels; the preview shows
only the 4 visible stats with a sealed-Halo note (not unlocked). The
renderer **always** validates first — an invalid fixture renders the safe
blocked state, so the sim can't bypass validation. styles.css adds
`.freesim*` / `.uploadeddev__tag--sim` (cyan accent, distinct from the moss
dev-harness) + `.uploadeddev__sealed`. `renderUploadedScanResultDev` gained
a backward-compatible `opts` param (existing callers unchanged). **Normal
flow untouched**: bare URL → menu; Develop Scan still opens the sealed
engine-offline gate; uploaded photos still produce nothing; both existing
`?dev` routes, the sample room, and all deep links verified unchanged;
console clean. Adversarial review (safety / validator / preservation / UX):
**0 findings**. Dev simulation needs an explicit query — not in the
screenshot pipeline.

## Uploaded Scan Result Renderer v1 — Dev Harness (2026-06-13 / BR-S020, app.js + scan-contract.js + index.html + styles.css)

A fourth **dev-only** view (`state.view==="dev"`) that previews what a
*future* uploaded-photo scan result would look like — **dev fixtures only,
no AI, no user-photo analysis**. Reachable ONLY via the URL query
`?dev=uploaded-result` or `?dev=uploaded-blocked` (no menu link, no product
CTA; the dev param gate takes precedence over the src/t/tab room gate).
`renderUploadedScanResultDev(result)` (app.js) **always** runs
`validateUploadedScanResult` first: `!ok` → the safe blocked state, `ok` →
a preview (artifact card, visible + extended stats, readings, evidence
board, safety-flags/schema), every surface labelled **DEV HARNESS / NOT
USER SCAN** with a "presentation scores of the image artifact — not the
person" caption. A new valid fixture `DEV_FIXTURES.validDevRendererResult`
(obviously a dev fixture, passes the validator) drives `?dev=uploaded-result`;
`?dev=uploaded-blocked` feeds an invalid fixture → blocked. index.html adds
`#devView`; styles.css adds `.dev` / `.uploadeddev*` and extends the
visibility matrix to four views. **Normal flow unchanged**: bare URL →
menu; Add Your Photo → Local Draft; Develop Scan still opens the sealed
engine-offline gate; uploaded photos still produce nothing; sample room +
deep links verified unchanged; console clean. The dev harness needs an
explicit query, so it is not in the headless screenshot pipeline.

## Scan Engine Foundation v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S019, scan-contract.js + app.js + index.html + styles.css)

New pure non-AI **safety valve** `scan-contract.js` (IIFE →
`window.BlueRoomScanContract`). `validateUploadedScanResult(result) ->
{ok, errors[], warnings[]}` enforces the uploaded-v1 contract
(kind/schemaVersion/status/source.mode; all four `safetyFlags` present and
false; `evidenceBoard` items `{lens, observation, visibleCue, effect,
confidence}`), blocks sample mixing (sample kind / `SRC-*` ids / v2
schema), and scans the forbidden human-rating lexicon in keys
(allowlist-guarded so legit keys like `label`/`archetypeClass` and the
`contains*` flags never false-trigger) and in **every string value**
(whole-word), enforces a bare `value` key positionally (allowed only as a
numeric stat under `stats.*`), and flags person-truth claims in
`artifact.title` + `readings.*`. A 4-pass adversarial review workflow
(safety / preservation / UX / simplicity) surfaced **3 confirmed safety
gaps** — forbidden terms unscanned in label/archetypeClass/material/family/
fileLabel *values*, a `value`-key bypass, and unscanned title person-truth
— all fixed before commit (3 nitpicks rejected). `createBlockedScanState(reason,
errors)` is a pure failure-state shape. `DEV_FIXTURES` (validMinimal + 4
invalid) are console/test only — never rendered as analysis. The validator
is pure: no DOM/AI/API/IO, no input mutation. app.js gains
`renderBlockedScan(b)` — a calm, archival safe-failure plate (errors
ledger; "no card/stats/oracle/receipts"; four return paths) — **FOUNDATION
ONLY, not wired to normal flow**. index.html loads the script before
app.js; styles.css adds `.gatepanel--blocked` / `.gateblock__errs`.
**No engine, no AI, no fake output**: the local draft still produces
nothing and "Develop scan" still only opens the sealed offline gate.
Reconciled `SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT` §4/§6 evidence field names to
`{lens, observation, visibleCue, effect, confidence}` to match the
validator (Spec Change Review). `FILE_MAP` registers `scan-contract.js`.
Verified live: all 5 fixtures validate as expected; sample room + both
deep links unchanged; console clean.

## Scan Engine Contract v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S018, docs only)

New ACTIVE spec `docs/SCAN_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md` — the allowed output shape
and safety boundaries for a *future* engine that develops an **uploaded**
photo. Documentation only: **runtime behavior intentionally unchanged**
(no app.js/data.js/styles.css edits) — the local draft still produces no
stats and "Develop scan" still only opens the engine-offline gate. The
contract defines: red lines (no person/beauty/biology/identity/worth/fake-
psychology), the `ScanResultUploaded v1` shape (a separate `kind`, reusing
ScanResult v2 stat/receipt/confidence conventions but never mixed with
`SOURCES`/`SCAN_RESULTS_V2`), the result lifecycle (`local_draft` /
`gate_offline` active; `scan_pending/complete/failed_future` placeholders),
allowed vs forbidden lenses, receipt rules, the Free-vs-Halo reveal model,
and engine-connection gates (schema-validate + block unsafe fields before
any engine is wired). `docs/FILE_MAP.md` registers the new spec (governance:
no new doc without a FILE_MAP entry). Spec Change Review only — no LOCKED
law changed. Next: a non-AI Scan Contract Validator Stub (TASK_QUEUE).

## Local Draft Polish v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S017, app.js + styles.css)

Presentation-only polish of the browser-local intake + sealed gate — no
engine, no analysis. The real `file.name` still lives on `draft`; two
display helpers (`fileTypeLabel()`, `cleanFileLabel()`) format a clean
label so the card title is now **"Local image"** with a compact secondary
line "PNG · 1.0 MB · ac277f35…eb8.png" (long names shortened, extension
kept) — no more raw ugly filename as the title. Card hierarchy tightened:
prominent "No scan has run yet." status + quiet "Image loaded in this
browser only." sub; intake lead trimmed to a next-step "Ready for scan
development." Develop CTA subcopy → "Stage artifact for future scan
engine." (honest, no implication a scan ran). Gate clarity: an "engine
offline" status dot on the tag and a slightly stronger "Development
pending" — ledger, disabled Run-engine button, and all "nothing has run"
copy unchanged. Still reads only `draft`; never calls getActiveScan/
getScanResult or touches SOURCES/SCAN_RESULTS_V2; no numbers/stats on the
draft beyond honest file size. Sample room + deep links untouched; gate/
intake remain not headlessly capturable (no screenshots).

## Scan Development Gate v1 (2026-06-13 / BR-S016, app.js + styles.css)

The Local Draft intake now carries a quiet **"Develop scan"** CTA (subcopy
"Scan engine not connected yet."). Clicking it sets `state.draftGate = true`
and re-renders `#draftView` as a sealed **Scan Development Gate**
(`renderGate()`): an "Engine offline" tag, a dimmed sealed thumbnail of the
staged artifact, the fixed ledger (No analysis has run · No stats have been
generated · No receipts exist · No oracle exists · No Halo result exists),
a DISABLED "Run engine · offline" button, "Development pending" + "Ready for
future scan engine." It generates NOTHING and never calls
`getActiveScan()`/`getScanResult()` or touches `SOURCES`/`SCAN_RESULTS_V2`
— it reads only `draft`. Return paths: Return to local draft
(`data-gate="close"`) · Replace image · Enter sample scan room · Main menu;
Escape steps back (gate → intake → menu); a fresh/replaced draft and the
menu Resume both land on the intake. Like the intake, the gate needs a
user-picked file, so it is not headlessly capturable (not screenshotted).
Sample room, menu, and deep links are unchanged. Styles: `.gate`,
`.gatepanel*`, `.gatecheck`, `.gateactions`, `.draft__develop*` (existing
tokens; flat plate, no animation).

## Local Draft intake v1 (2026-06-13, index.html + app.js + styles.css)

"Add your photo" is now a real browser-local intake. A hidden image file
input feeds `loadDraftFile()`, which builds a `URL.createObjectURL`
preview and switches to a third view (`draft`) showing a LOCAL DRAFT
artifact card + honest copy (browser-local only / no scan has run / ready
for scan development / no analysis). No upload, no storage, no AI, and NO
fabricated stats/receipts/oracle/hidden/serial. Non-image files are
rejected with a short message; large files (>25 MB) warn but still
preview; object URLs are revoked on replace. Return paths: Replace image ·
Enter sample scan room · Main menu · Resume local draft (menu re-renders
to offer Resume). Deep links and the sample room are untouched. The draft
view needs a user-selected file, so it is NOT in the headless capture set
(verified live via the preview tools instead); only `menu-front`
refreshed (the Add button is now active, not "· later").

## Main Menu v1 (2026-06-13, index.html + app.js + styles.css + capture-screens.ps1)

Added a front-door **menu view** before the scan room, using the existing
SRC-01 sample only (no new asset). Shows the same photo two ways — a matte
**Free Pull** plate and a copper-edged **Halo Mint** artifact — with brand,
thesis, a compliant trust line ("…it reads frame, gesture and signal, never
the person"; the suggested "beauty/face" wording was dropped to honour
COPY_SYSTEM + the task's own no-beauty-language rule), the tier chips, an
"Enter Scan Room" CTA and a disabled "Add your photo · later" secondary.
Implemented as `state.view` + `body[data-view]` (`applyView()`); deep links
with any `src/t/tab` param bypass the menu (`view="room"` at init). Scan
room DOM/rendering/gating untouched. One new no-param screenshot state
(`menu-front`) added to the capture pipeline + SCREENS.md (all existing
param shots bypass the menu, so a bare-URL shot is the only way to review
it).

## Conversion spine pass (2026-06-13, app.js + styles.css)

Three additive fixes from the first-time product audit, no redesign:
(1) **Hero orientation line** — `render()` injects one serif line above the
card in `#stageZone` ("Every photo is already a card. The room develops
it.") + a mono `Sample scan · 0X / 02` cue (`pad2(src.no)/pad2(SOURCES.length)`)
so demo photos read as fixtures. `.stageintro*` in styles; `.stagezone`
top padding trimmed 16→9px to protect the 1600×900 card-fit (verified —
card + mint strip uncut). (2) **Develop CTA weight** — free Develop
module gets modifier `unlock--spine`: a material-edged plate (left border
+ faint top-bleed in the source's own `--halo-a`, like `.dplate--mint`),
lead line + label lifted one tier. No copy change, no animation; the
deliverables box already names hidden stat/evidence/dossier/mint/oracle.
(3) **Free Hidden Stat sealed** — free `dhidden--tease` score wrapped in a
dashed compartment + mono "SEALED · DEVELOPMENT PENDING" stamp (mirrors
Evidence Board "development pending"); value stays withheld `··`; Halo
reveal (bold `--halo-a` number) untouched. Selectors: `.stageintro*`,
`.unlock--spine`, `.dhidden--tease .dhidden__score`, `.dhidden__seal`.
NOTE: the dossier rhythm `:nth-of-type` selectors still depend on plate
order — unchanged here.

## Micro-legibility + card focus pocket (2026-06-12, styles.css only)

Half-step lifts: receipt cue `#bcb7ae` (between body/primary tiers),
basis 9.5px, kv labels ghost→meta + values →silver, fit-cell values
→silver, technical-receipt rows →meta/silver. Focus pocket: `.stagezone`
two-layer static radial (faint warm lift at the card, edge fall-off into
the room); shiny variant tints the lift with `--halo-a` at 5%. No
animation, no blur, no layout change. Five selector groups total.

## Evidence Board v2 + metrics readability (2026-06-12, app.js + styles.css)

Evidence Board now renders v2 structured receipts (effect mark +
confidence tag + cue + basis) — free shows tierOutputs.free.receiptsShown,
halo shows all; legacy prose receipts remain as fallback when v2 is
absent. Metrics instruments lifted one tier (impact labels/values,
diamond text 4.6px, caps/captions ghost→meta); track bgs warmed. Free
CTA: desc/more lines meta tier, material-tinted button border/bg
(static). TODO(v2-render) for receipts removed; route label in Source
Record still pending (TASK_QUEUE).

## DESIGN_TOKENS pass 2 (2026-06-12, styles.css only)

Readability: `--t-body/meta/ghost` lifted; hardcoded warm greys folded
into tiers; dossier/right-panel body text up ~0.5px; undeveloped lines
and end-marks moved ghost→meta. Dossier rhythm via `:nth-of-type` on the
fixed plate order: quiet (01, 06) tighter + smaller titles; LOUD (04, 07)
extra padding/margin + faint bg lift + brighter top edge. Hidden Stat
reveal: 64px number (44px tease), 20px read. Oracle finale: 27px serif.
CTA name 13px. No new effects/animation. NOTE: rhythm selectors depend on
plate order in renderDossier() — reorder plates ⇒ update these selectors.

## DESIGN_TOKENS pass 1 (2026-06-12, styles.css only)

Vault text scale: 5 named tiers (`--t-display/primary/body/meta/ghost`),
warm archive greys, no pure white — legacy color vars alias to the tiers
so every rule inherited the shift. Room warmed (ink + line tokens).
Plates flattened: `--r-plate: 4px`, flat backgrounds, top-edge light on
modules/dplates. Artifact raised: deeper static card shadow + inset top
light. Accent economy: removed shiny accent overrides from aura chips,
balance dot, diagram strokes/labels, dossier stat bars; developed-state
diamond is quiet silver — the card alone carries the material. No
animation/backdrop-filter/blend-mode added. Dossier rhythm and stat-meter
redesign deliberately NOT applied (later passes).

## ScanResult v2 rendering integration (2026-06-12, app.js)

`getScanResult(src)` / `getActiveScan()` / `getTierOutput(scan, treatment)`
helpers in app.js. v2 is now the preferred source (legacy fallback via
`||` everywhere) for: card + reading-panel + dossier stat values and
visibility (`tierOutputs.free.statsShown` / `stats.freeVisible`), hidden
stat (`conditionalStats`), Fit+Aura Impact/Lore (`haloExtended`), Mint
Record serial/material/triggers, and both oracles. Still legacy with
`// TODO(v2-render)` markers: Evidence Board prose receipts and the
Metrics tab (signalMix/pressure/fitMatrix aren't in v2). Visual output
unchanged by design.

## ScanResult v2 data shape (2026-06-12, data.js only)

Append-only block at the end of `data.js`: `V2_EXTRAS` (route, gate
status, confidence, structured receipts, warnings per source) +
`toScanResultV2()` (maps legacy fields — no duplication) +
`SCAN_RESULTS_V2`. **Not yet read by app.js** — it's the stable shape
for later Free/Halo rendering. To change v2 content: edit `V2_EXTRAS`
or the mapped legacy fields; never fork values that exist in legacy data.

## SPINE promotion (2026-06-12, docs only)

Five active specs promoted from docs/research/SPINE.md: SCAN_ROUTING_SPEC
(gate + routes), SCAN_ENGINE_SPEC (lenses, stats, confidence, receipts),
ARCHETYPE_LIBRARY (selection + naming), PERFORMANCE_BUDGET (cost +
effects law), DESIGN_TOKENS (Room/Plate/Artifact grammar). No code
touched. Build sessions read the relevant spec, not raw research.

## Governance / research organization (2026-06-12)

Governance and research docs were reorganized — no code touched.
Future sessions: read `docs/FILE_MAP.md` + `docs/SESSION_BRIEF.md` first;
authority/status/funnel rules live in `docs/GOVERNANCE_OS.md`; filtered
research lives in `docs/research/SPINE.md` (RESEARCH authority — promote
before building).

## To change the scroll dossier

- **Edit:** content in `data.js` → `dossier` per source (`record`,
  `evidence` ×6 with `free` flags, `statNotes`, `hidden`, `mint`,
  `oracle`); structure in `app.js` → `renderDossier()` + `dplate()`;
  styles in `styles.css` (`.dplate`, `.drecord`, `.receipt`, `.dstat`,
  `.dhidden`, `.dfitaura`, `.doracle`).
- **Affects:** the archive below the hero, free→paid persuasion.
- **Can break:** the 7-section cap (cut, don't grow); the no-paywall-
  language rule (never "locked/upgrade/premium" — use "undeveloped /
  archive pull / development pending").
- **Test:** both sources × free/halo; free shows 3 receipts + undeveloped
  plate, teased hidden stat, reserved serial + CTA; halo shows all 6
  receipts, full hidden stat, real serial + material.

### Plate 01 — filing event + serial lineage (BR-S038)

- **Edit:** `app.js` → `renderDossier()` Plate 01 block — `fileSteps`
  (capture → route → scan status → filed-as class, from `getScanResult(src)`)
  and `lineageRows` (Object → Scan → Card → Mint); styles in `styles.css`
  (`.dfile`, `.dfiling__*`, `.dlineage*`, all flat — edge+tone+type only).
- **Source data:** `src.capture.code`, `scan.route/scanStatus/scanId/`
  `archetype.class`, `d.record.objectNo`, `c.serial`,
  `scan.tierOutputs.{free.serial|halo.mintSerial}` (already present; no
  data.js change). objectNo now lives ONLY here (removed from `.drecord`).
- **Locked rules:** the archetype **class** label may recur (content-axis
  join, DEPTH model) but the **discovery-note prose is Halo-only** — it lives
  in the right-panel "Artifact Archetype" module (`app.js` ~650), do NOT
  repeat it on Plate 01. Card + Mint serials are **developed identities** →
  masked `····` on Free, assigned on Halo (latent→developed law); pull the
  serials from `tierOutputs`, never hand-roll a mask. No confidence/0–100 on
  this surface. Add nothing as a `<section class="dplate">` (keep the 7-plate
  `:nth-of-type` rhythm — see the dossier-rhythm note above).
- **Test:** both sources × free/halo — filing chain reads the same in both
  states; lineage Card+Mint show `····` (ghost) on Free, real serials on Halo;
  console clean; 7 plates.

## To change Halo Mint material per source

- **Edit:** `data.js` → `halo: { material, a, b, c }` per source. The
  three colors feed `--halo-a/b/c` on the card and body; the conic edge,
  glow, sparkle accents, stat bars and dossier accents all follow.
- **Test:** SRC 01 mints copper-warm, SRC 02 frost-cold; photo stays
  readable; no cheap rainbow.

## To add a new source

1. Add photo to `assets/`.
2. In `data.js`, copy an existing SOURCES entry and rewrite every field:
   card content, capture, markers, analysis, `photoTuning`, `diagram`
   (with `aspect` if portrait), `metrics`, receipts, mint record.
3. In `index.html`, add a button to `#sourceToggle` with the next
   `data-source` index; keyboard keys 1/2 are hardcoded in `app.js` — extend
   if needed.
- **Note:** V1 is deliberately capped at 2 sources (DECISION_LOG) — log a
  decision before adding a third.
- **Test:** every tab and treatment for the new source; image loads; no
  console errors.

## To change the treatment hierarchy / tier names

- **Current state (2026-06-12):** customer-facing toggle = Free Pull /
  Halo Mint (internal key `shiny`). Signature Mint (internal key `mint`)
  is a Lab state reachable via keyboard `M` only — no toggle button.
- **Edit:** `index.html` (#treatmentToggle buttons), `data.js`
  (`TREATMENTS` labels/stamps/strips), `app.js` (state badge ternary,
  unlock CTA copy, keyboard map).
- **Can break:** purchase-story clarity — paid must read "the card
  developed", never "locked content" / "premium option" / cosmetic toggle.
- **Test:** toggle shows two tiers; `M` still reaches Lab; CTA buttons
  switch to Halo Mint.

## To add a new treatment

1. `data.js` → add an entry to `TREATMENTS` (label, rarity, stamp, strip).
2. `index.html` → add a button to `#treatmentToggle`.
3. `styles.css` → new `.card[data-treatment="x"]` block (+ optional
   `body[data-treatment="x"]` accents). Reuse the existing layer system
   (foil/shimmer/halo/sparkles/scrim/tone) — do not add new card DOM.
4. `app.js` → update the state badge ternary in `renderReadingPanel`, the
   keyboard map, and gating if the new tier changes what's unlocked.
- **Can break:** the "few treatment states" law — design it in
  `docs/CARD_TECH_LAB.md` first, then log the decision.
- **Test:** all tabs/sources under the new treatment; photo readability.

## To add profile layers later (BACKLOG)

- **Principle (canon: `GOLDEN_NUGGETS` #9):** user-declared lore, never inferred.
- **Where it would live:** new optional `profile` object per source in
  `data.js`; rendered as additional right-panel modules (and later dossier
  sections) — **not** on the card front beyond, at most, a tiny stamp.
- **Can break:** the no-face-rating law if a layer ever *infers* traits —
  layers must be declared by the user.
- **Test:** right panel with and without the profile object (must degrade
  gracefully when absent).
